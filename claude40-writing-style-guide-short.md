# Academic Writing Style Guide

**IMPORTANT**: This guide uses Australian/UK spelling and punctuation conventions throughout. These conventions must be applied consistently in all writing.

## Voice and Perspective

### Primary Voice
- **First person plural ("we")** for collaborative work
- **First person singular ("I")** for solo reflections or personal observations
- **Active voice preferred** (approx. 70-80% of sentences)
  - Keep some passive voice for variety and when emphasising the action over the actor
  - Transform obvious passive constructions: "It was determined that" → "We determined that"

## Tone and Register

### Formality
- **Formal but accessible**: Technical precision without unnecessary jargon
- Define specialist terms on first use
- Provide context before diving into technical details

### Academic Confidence
- **Calibrated assertions**: Match claims to evidence strength
- Maintain epistemic humility while avoiding excessive hedging
- Eliminate double qualifiers ("may perhaps" → "may")
- Acceptable hedging: "suggests," "indicates," "appears to"
- Avoid overconfidence trending in current academic writing

## Sentence and Paragraph Structure

### Sentence Length
- **Maintain variety**: Mix short, medium, and long sentences
- Break extreme run-ons (>40 words with multiple subclauses)
- Keep well-constructed longer sentences that flow naturally
- Use shorter sentences for emphasis and clarity of key points

### Paragraph Length
- **Target range**: 100-180 words for most paragraphs
- Break paragraphs exceeding 200 words at natural transition points
- Vary paragraph length to maintain rhythm and allow nuanced exploration
- Single-sentence paragraphs acceptable for emphasis

### Parentheticals
- **Minimise use**: Integrate most parenthetical information into main sentences
- Acceptable uses:
  - Brief clarifications (e.g., acronym definitions)
  - Citation years
  - Simple examples
- Transform: "The dataset was ready (with only a few hours of processing)" → "The dataset was ready after only a few hours of processing"

## Clarity and Concision

### Opening Sentences
- **Direct and clear**: Eliminate throat-clearing phrases
- Remove: "It should be noted that," "It is important to mention"
- Begin with the main point while maintaining appropriate academic caution

### Transitions
- **Vary connective phrases** to avoid repetition:
  - Furthermore → Additionally, In addition, Beyond this
  - Moreover → Also, Further, What's more
  - However → Yet, Still, That said, Conversely
  - Nevertheless → Even so, Despite this, Nonetheless

### Technical Details
- **Position at clause or sentence end** when possible
- Maintain all necessary specifications
- Example: "We used 150 × 150 m cutouts centred on each mound" rather than "Using 150 × 150 m cutouts (22,500 sq m) centred on..."

## Technical Writing Conventions

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine in text
- Use numerals for 10 and above
- Always use numerals with units (5 m, 3 hours)
- Use commas in thousands (10,827 features)

### Abbreviations and Acronyms
- Define on first use: "Field Acquired Information Management Systems (FAIMS)"
- Common abbreviations don't need definition (GPS, GIS, DNA)
- Occasionally spell out acronyms at section/paragraph beginnings to break up strings
- Avoid starting sentences with abbreviations

### Australian/UK Spelling and Punctuation (ALWAYS USE)

#### Spelling Conventions
- **-ise endings**: recognise, digitise, analyse, prioritise, organise, emphasise
- **-our endings**: colour, behaviour, honour, favour, labour, neighbour
- **Double 'l'**: modelling, labelling, travelling, cancelled, jewellery
- **-re endings**: centre, metre, theatre (not center, meter, theater)
- **-ogue endings**: catalogue, dialogue, analogue (not catalog, dialog, analog)
- **Specific terms**:
  - artefact (not artifact)
  - programme (for schedule/plan), program (for software only)
  - defence (not defense)
  - licence (noun), license (verb)
  - practice (noun), practise (verb)
  - grey (not gray)
  - judgement (not judgment)
  - enquiry (not inquiry)

#### Punctuation Rules
- **Single quotation marks** for primary quotes: 'like this'
- **Double quotation marks** for quotes within quotes: 'He said "hello" to me'
- **Punctuation outside quotation marks**: The site was 'significant'.
- **-ise/-isation consistency**: Use 'organisation' not 'organization'
- **Serial comma** (Oxford comma): Yes, always use
- **En dash** for ranges: 2009–2011 (not hyphen)
- **Spaced en dash** for parenthetical statements: The results – which were surprising – indicate

#### Common American Spellings to Avoid
Quick checklist for find/replace:
- analyze → analyse
- organize → organise  
- recognize → recognise
- archeology → archaeology
- artifact → artefact
- behavior → behaviour
- color → colour
- favor → favour
- labor → labour
- center → centre
- meter → metre
- defense → defence
- program (non-software) → programme

## Data and Evidence

### Quantitative Presentation
- Include exact numbers with percentages: "773 mounds (94.3%)"
- Report statistics clearly: "χ² = 12.3, p < 0.001"
- Round appropriately to meaningful precision

### Limitations and Transparency
- Acknowledge constraints directly: "Due to time constraints..."
- State data limitations: "Our data about robbing are coarse"
- Indicate need for future work: "Further investigation is necessary"
- Position limitations clearly without undermining the entire contribution

## Section Structure

### Conclusions
- **End with measured strength**: Avoid trailing off with caveats
- Summarise key findings with appropriate confidence
- Place major limitations before final statements
- Final sentence should be declarative while maintaining nuance

### Signposting
- Use explicit section introductions: "This section examines..."
- Number lists for multiple points
- Write topic sentences that preview paragraph content
- Use descriptive headings (Title Case for major sections, sentence case for subsections)

## Special Considerations

### Digital Scholarship
- Explain technical concepts for interdisciplinary audiences
- Include URLs for digital supplements
- Describe data availability and reuse potential

### Methodological Reflexivity
- Discuss rationale for chosen approaches
- Acknowledge when methods required adaptation
- Compare with alternatives when relevant

### Collaborative Attribution
- Credit specific contributions
- Use "we" for collaborative projects even when primarily individual work
- Name key contributors in acknowledgements

## Writing Process

### Revision Priorities
1. Check for American spellings (use find/replace for common ones)
2. Eliminate extreme run-on sentences
3. Remove double hedging ("may perhaps")
4. Integrate parenthetical statements
5. Vary transition words
6. Strengthen opening sentences (remove throat-clearing)
7. Check passive/active voice balance
8. Break overlong paragraphs
9. Position technical details appropriately
10. Verify quotation mark style and punctuation placement

### Style Consistency
- Oxford comma always
- Italics for key terms on first introduction
- Quotation marks for contested terms
