Hi Claude, please analyse the Jira export CSV to create a comprehensive development report. Before writing the report, please:

1. **Data Exploration**: Examine the CSV structure and provide a summary of:
   - Total number of issues and date range covered
   - Available columns and status values
   - Any data quality issues

2. **Status Mapping**: Map Jira statuses to these categories and show your mapping:
   - Done: [list Jira statuses that indicate completion]
   - Rejected: [list Jira statuses that indicate rejection/cancellation]  
   - Future development: [list Jira statuses that indicate planned future work]

3. **Technical Classification**: Classify issues as technical vs non-technical using [specify criteria - e.g., issue type, labels, keywords in summary/description]

4. **Report Generation**: Using the '2025-02 Development Report' as a structural model and applying the 'Writing style guide', create a comprehensive report covering [specify exact date range] with these sections:
   - [List desired sections]

5. **Required Analysis**:
   - Count and percentage for each category (Done/Rejected/Future development)
   - Count and percentage of Done vs Future development (excluding Rejected)
   - Separate analysis for technical vs non-technical issues
   - Verification that no issues are 'Selected for Development' or 'In Progress'

6. **Characterisation**: Describe the nature of completed work versus deferred work, highlighting key themes and patterns.

Provide the final report as a markdown artifact.
