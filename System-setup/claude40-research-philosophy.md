## Part I: Foundations

### 1. Intellectual Framework

#### 1.1 Foundational Rationale & Scholarly Aims

This research philosophy guides the pursuit of knowledge through rigorous, critical, transparent, and ethically sound scholarship. Research aspires to:

1. **Contribute Meaningfully:** Address identified gaps in disciplinary knowledge (e.g., understanding early Panhellenism in "Barbarophonos," 2005; evaluating ML in "Validating ML Predictions," 2024), rigorously test assumptions, and generate robust, verifiable, and reusable findings.

2. **Embrace Problem-Oriented Inquiry:** Frame research to answer specific questions (e.g., the environmental context of the Neolithic transition in Connor et al., "Straldzha Mire," 2013) or enlighten scholarly debate through meticulous generation and critical evaluation of evidence (e.g., reassessing Tacitus in "Interpreting the Brigantian Revolt," 2004).

3. **Integrate Diverse Perspectives:** Actively seek and integrate diverse lines of evidence (e.g., textual and archaeological in "Homer as History," 2009) and methodological approaches (e.g., the multidisciplinary design of TRAP, Ch1) to achieve holistic understanding.

4. **Innovate Responsibly:** View the development and application of new methods or tools (e.g., FAIMS mobile data collection; crowdsourcing map digitization in Sobotkova et al., "Creating Geospatial Datasets," 2023) as research itself, while being mindful of ethical implications.

5. **Foster Collaborative & Cumulative Science:** Commit to making research processes and outputs—including data, metadata, paradata, methods, and software—as accessible, interoperable, and reusable as possible, in line with FAIR principles.

6. **Reflect & Evolve:** Acknowledge that this philosophy is a living document, subject to refinement as understanding and disciplinary best practices evolve.

#### 1.2 Epistemological Stance

**Pragmatic Empiricism with Critical Self-Awareness**

The approach to knowledge is pragmatic and broadly empiricist, believing that understanding advances through rigorous collection, critical evaluation, and interpretation of evidence. This empiricism is not naive—it's coupled with keen awareness of the complexities, biases, limitations, and taphonomic issues in historical and archaeological data.

Embracing the self-correcting nature of the scientific method (broadly construed to include rigorous humanities scholarship), acknowledging the iterative processes in refining knowledge. This aligns with a Popperian perspective on knowledge growth through conjecture and refutation.

#### 1.3 Disciplinary & Theoretical Orientation

**Advocating for Scientific Approaches:** While valuing interdisciplinary insights, history and archaeology benefit significantly from scientific approaches concerning research design, methodological rigour, data analysis, and transparency.

**Specific Frameworks:**
- **Archaeology:** Cognitive-Processualism—valuing processual emphasis on systemic change over the *longue durée* while acknowledging human agency and cognition
- **History:** Annales School emphasis on the *longue durée*
- **Scale & Generalization:** Respecting issues of scale and granularity, acknowledging potential for reductionism while aspiring for appropriate generalisation

**Hypothesis Generation & Testing:** A classical liberal/libertarian perspective with conservative tendencies may inform research topic choice and initial questions, generating novel hypotheses. Critically, such hypotheses are then subjected to rigorous, evidence-based testing, with commitment to accepting outcomes even if they refute initial ideas.
