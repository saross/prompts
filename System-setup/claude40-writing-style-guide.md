# Academic Writing Style Guide (Long Version)

**NOTE ON SPELLING CONVENTIONS**: This guide focuses on writing style and structure. Spelling conventions (Australian/UK or US English) are handled separately based on target publication requirements.

**NOTE ON CITATIONS**: Citation style varies by target publication and will be specified separately when needed.

## Quick Reference Section

### Most Essential Reminders
- **Voice**: Active voice 70-80% of the time; use passive for variety but not when it mars clarity
- **Paragraphs**: Target 100-180 words
- **Sentences**: Vary length; break extreme run-ons over 40 words
- **Hedging**: No double qualifiers ("may perhaps" → "may")
- **Demonstratives**: Never standalone 'this' or 'that' – always use as modifiers
- **Transitions**: Vary connectives to avoid repetition
- **Numbers**: Spell out 1-9, numerals for 10+, always numerals with units
- **Punctuation**: Oxford comma always, en dash for ranges (2009–2011)
- **Opening sentences**: No throat-clearing ("It should be noted that")
- **Parentheticals**: Minimise and integrate into main text

## Voice and Perspective

### Primary Voice
- **First person plural ("we")** for all collaborative work (use unless specifically directed otherwise)
- **First person singular ("I")** only when explicitly requested
- **Active voice preferred** (approx. 70-80% of sentences)
  - Prefer active voice except when it creates repetition
  - Use passive voice for variety, but not when it creates awkwardness or mars clarity
  - **Prioritise clarity**: If active voice creates awkward constructions, use passive
  - Transform obvious passive constructions: "It was determined that" → "We determined that"

### Demonstrative Pronouns and Impersonal Constructions
- **Never use standalone 'this' or 'that'**: Always use as modifiers
  - ❌ "This suggests a new interpretation."
  - ✓ "This evidence suggests a new interpretation."
  - ❌ "That was unexpected."
  - ✓ "That result was unexpected."
- **Avoid impersonal constructions**: Minimise 'this is', 'there are', 'it is'
  - ❌ "There are three factors that influence site preservation."
  - ✓ "Three factors influence site preservation."
  - ❌ "It is important to consider the temporal context."
  - ✓ "The temporal context requires careful consideration."
  - Exception: Use when alternatives create convoluted circumlocutions

## Tone and Register

### Formality
- **Formal but accessible**: Technical precision without unnecessary jargon
- **Clarity over formality**: When formal constructions impede understanding, choose clarity
- Define specialist terms on first use
- Provide context before diving into technical details

### Academic Confidence
- **Calibrated assertions**: Match claims to evidence strength
- Maintain epistemic humility while avoiding excessive hedging
- Eliminate double qualifiers ("may perhaps" → "may")
- Acceptable hedging: "suggests," "indicates," "appears to," "seems to"
- Avoid overconfidence trending in current academic writing

**Example progression:**
- ❌ Too strong: "Our model successfully detected burial mounds across the study area."
- ❌ Over-hedged: "It might perhaps be possible that our model may have potentially detected some features that could be burial mounds."
- ✓ Calibrated: "Our attempt to deploy a pre-trained CNN demonstrates the limitations of this approach when it is used to detect varied features of different sizes within a heterogeneous landscape."
- ✓ Alternative: "A conservative estimate based on our work suggests our crowdsourcing approach is most efficient for projects recording 10,000–60,000 features."

## Sentence and Paragraph Structure

### Sentence Length
- **Maintain variety**: Mix short, medium, and long sentences
- Break extreme run-ons (>40 words with multiple subclauses)
- Keep well-constructed longer sentences that flow naturally
- Use shorter sentences for emphasis and clarity of key points

**Example paragraph demonstrating rhythm:**
> The excavation revealed three distinct occupation phases. Each phase showed evidence of intensive food processing, including grinding stones, hearth features, and scattered bone fragments representing at least twelve species of fauna. While the earliest phase (c. 3,500 BP) contained predominantly local materials, the two later phases incorporated exotic stone tools and marine shell beads, suggesting the development of long-distance exchange networks that connected inland communities with coastal groups over 200 kilometres away.

(Note: Short opener → medium detail → long synthesis. 16, 28, and 44 words respectively.)

### Paragraph Length
- **Target range**: 100-180 words for most paragraphs
- Break paragraphs exceeding 200 words at natural transition points
- Vary paragraph length to maintain rhythm and allow nuanced exploration
- Single-sentence paragraphs acceptable for emphasis

### Parentheticals
- **Minimise use**: Integrate most parenthetical information into main sentences
- Acceptable uses:
  - Brief clarifications (e.g., acronym definitions)
  - Citation years
  - Simple examples
- Transform: "The dataset was ready (with only a few hours of processing)" → "The dataset was ready after only a few hours of processing"

**Before/after examples:**
- ❌ "The survey (which took six weeks to complete) covered 15 sq km."
- ✓ "The six-week survey covered 15 sq km."

- ❌ "We used machine learning (specifically, a Random Forest classifier) to identify features."
- ✓ "We used machine learning, specifically a Random Forest classifier, to identify features."

- ❌ "The methodology (described in detail in section 3.2) requires careful calibration."
- ✓ "The methodology, described in detail in section 3.2, requires careful calibration."

## Clarity and Concision

### Opening Sentences
- **Direct and clear**: Eliminate throat-clearing phrases
- Remove: "It should be noted that," "It is important to mention," "It is worth noting"
- Begin with the main point while maintaining appropriate academic caution

**Before/after examples:**
- ❌ "It should be noted that the ceramic assemblage displays significant variation."
- ✓ "The ceramic assemblage displays significant variation."

- ❌ "It is important to note that digital methods have transformed archaeological survey."
- ✓ "Digital methods have transformed archaeological survey."

- ❌ "What we found particularly interesting was that the algorithm detected 94% of known sites."
- ✓ "The algorithm detected 94% of known sites, exceeding our initial expectations."

- ❌ "It is worth mentioning that the sample size limits our conclusions."
- ✓ "The sample size limits our conclusions."

### Transitions
- **Vary connective phrases** to avoid repetition:
  - **Addition**: Furthermore → Additionally, In addition, Beyond this, Moreover → Also, Further, What's more
  - **Contrast**: However → Yet, Still, That said, Conversely, By contrast, On the other hand
  - **Concession**: Nevertheless → Even so, Despite this, Nonetheless, Notwithstanding
  - **Result**: Therefore → Thus, Consequently, As a result, Hence, Accordingly
  - **Example**: For example → For instance, To illustrate, As an illustration, Consider
  - **Summary**: In conclusion → To summarise, Taken together, Overall, In sum
  - **Sequence**: First/Second/Third → Initially/Subsequently/Finally, To begin/Next/Lastly

### Integrating Evidence and Quotations
- **Smooth integration**: Introduce quotes and evidence as part of the natural flow
- Avoid dropped quotes – always provide context
- **Varied attribution verbs**: Match verb strength to evidence strength
  - Strong evidence: demonstrates, establishes, proves, confirms, verifies
  - Moderate evidence: indicates, suggests, reveals, shows, illustrates
  - Interpretive claims: argues, contends, proposes, maintains, asserts
  - Neutral reporting: notes, observes, reports, documents, describes
- Avoid repetitive "states that" or "says that" constructions

**Examples of smooth integration:**
- ❌ "Previous research is relevant. 'Digital methods revolutionised fieldwork' (Smith 2020, 45)."
- ✓ "Smith's (2020, 45) observation that 'digital methods revolutionised fieldwork' captures the transformation in archaeological practice."

- ❌ "The data shows a pattern. Jones (2019) states that population declined."
- ✓ "The data reveals a pattern that Jones (2019) interprets as evidence of population decline."

### Technical Details
- **Position at clause or sentence end** when possible
- Maintain all necessary specifications
- Example: "We used 150 × 150 m cutouts centred on each mound" rather than "Using 150 × 150 m cutouts (22,500 sq m) centred on..."

## Technical Writing Conventions

### Numbers
- **Basic rules**:
  - Spell out one through nine in text
  - Use numerals for 10 and above
  - Always use numerals with units (5 m, 3 hours, 7 kg)
  - Use commas in thousands (10,827 features, 1,234,567)
- **Special cases**:
  - Start of sentence: Spell out any number ("Fifteen sites..." not "15 sites...")
  - Percentages: Always use numerals (7% not seven percent)
  - Ages and dates: Use numerals (3 years old, 5th century)
  - Decimal numbers: Always use numerals (3.7, 0.05)
  - Ranges: Use en dash with spaces (5–10 samples, 2009–2011)

### Abbreviations and Acronyms
- Define on first use: "Field Acquired Information Management Systems (FAIMS)"
- Common abbreviations don't need definition (GPS, GIS, DNA, UNESCO, BC/AD, BP)
- Occasionally spell out acronyms at section/paragraph beginnings to break up strings
- Avoid starting sentences with abbreviations
- Latin abbreviations: Use sparingly
  - e.g. (for example) – use in parentheses only
  - i.e. (that is) – use in parentheses only
  - cf. (compare) – acceptable in citations
  - et al. (and others) – standard for multiple authors

### Punctuation Conventions
- **Serial comma** (Oxford comma): Always use
  - "Sites included settlements, burials, and ceremonial centres."
- **En dash** (–) vs hyphen (-):
  - En dash for ranges: 2009–2011, pp. 45–67
  - En dash with spaces for parenthetical statements: The results – which surprised us – indicate
  - Hyphen for compound words: well-preserved, multi-period
- **Quotation marks**: Style depends on target publication (UK single vs US double)
- **Semicolons**: Use for complex lists or to join related independent clauses
- **Colons**: Introduce lists, explanations, or elaborations

## Data and Evidence

### Quantitative Presentation
- Include exact numbers with percentages: "773 mounds (94.3%)"
- Report statistics clearly: "χ² = 12.3, p < 0.001"
- Round appropriately to meaningful precision
- Present related statistics together for easy comparison

**Example of smooth integration:**
> Our analysis identified 1,247 potential archaeological features across the study area, with 819 mounds (65.7%) showing evidence of modification. The remaining 428 features (34.3%) appeared undisturbed, though surface visibility limited our confidence in this assessment. Statistical testing revealed a significant relationship between mound size and modification (χ² = 23.4, df = 3, p < 0.001), with larger mounds more likely to show disturbance.

### Limitations and Transparency
- Acknowledge constraints directly: "Due to time constraints..."
- State data limitations: "Our data about robbing are coarse"
- Indicate need for future work: "Further investigation is necessary"
- Position limitations clearly without undermining the entire contribution
- Frame limitations constructively when possible

**Examples:**
- ✓ "While our sample size limits generalisation, the patterns observed warrant further investigation."
- ✓ "The resolution of available satellite imagery constrained feature identification to structures larger than 5 m."

## Section Structure

### Conclusions
- **End with measured strength**: Avoid trailing off with caveats
- Summarise key findings with appropriate confidence
- Place major limitations before final statements
- Final sentence should be declarative while maintaining nuance

### Signposting
- Use explicit section introductions: "This section examines..."
- Number lists for multiple points
- Write topic sentences that preview paragraph content
- Use descriptive headings (Title Case for major sections, sentence case for subsections)
- Provide transitions between major sections

## Special Considerations

### Digital Scholarship
- Explain technical concepts for interdisciplinary audiences
- Include URLs for digital supplements
- Describe data availability and reuse potential
- Specify software versions and parameters for reproducibility

### Interdisciplinary Writing
- Define or explain technical terms from any discipline when first mentioned
- Use terminology most relevant to the point being made (archaeological, technological, etc.)
- Ensure all specialised concepts are accessible to readers from different fields
- Balance precision with comprehensibility across disciplines
- Consider glossaries for heavily technical pieces

### Technical and Statistical Details
- Include computational and statistical method details in main text by default
- Move to supplementary materials only when specifically instructed
- Provide sufficient detail for reproducibility and understanding
- Report all relevant parameters and settings

### Methodological Reflexivity
- Discuss rationale for chosen approaches
- Acknowledge when methods required adaptation
- Compare with alternatives when relevant
- Address potential biases or limitations in methodology

### Collaborative Attribution
- Credit specific contributions
- Use "we" for collaborative projects even when primarily individual work
- Name key contributors in acknowledgements
- Specify roles when relevant (data collection, analysis, writing)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Overused Phrases and Words
- Starting too many sentences with "This" (use specific nouns instead)
- Overusing "significant" or "important" (be specific about why)
- Vague pronouns with unclear antecedents
- Clichéd academic phrases: "Since the dawn of time," "Webster's dictionary defines..."
- Redundant phrases: "past history," "completely eliminate," "basic fundamentals"

### Structural Issues
- Paragraph sprawl (over 200 words without clear breaks)
- Inconsistent tense usage within sections
- Unclear connections between paragraphs
- Missing transitions between major ideas
- Burying the main point in the middle of paragraphs

### Style Inconsistencies
- Switching between formal and informal register
- Inconsistent use of technical terms
- Variable spelling conventions within the same document
- Shifting between first and third person inappropriately

## Writing Process
