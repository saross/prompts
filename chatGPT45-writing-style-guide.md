# Formal Prose Style Guide

This practical, nuanced style guide reflects your characteristic formal writing, adjusted and improved according to your preferences. Use this explicitly to generate formal prose.

## 1. General Style and Voice

### 1.1 Formality and Tone
- Scholarly, precise, formal tone.
- Clarity, analytical depth, objectivity, and precision.
- Avoid colloquial language, excessive jargon, unnecessary complexity.

### 1.2 Narrative Voice
- Primarily third-person, occasional first-person plural ("we") for methods or collective actions.
- Balance active and passive voice carefully:
  - Slight preference for active voice (clarity, readability).
  - Use passive voice strategically for objectivity, highlighting processes.

Example:  
"We assessed the impact of land use through predictive modelling and visual inspection of burial mounds."

## 2. Vocabulary and Terminology

### 2.1 Vocabulary Precision
- Precise, specific vocabulary consistently.
- Technical terms accurately and clearly.

### 2.2 Frequent Terms and Preferred Phrasing
Common terms:
- Archaeological methods: "systematic pedestrian survey," "surface artefact distribution," "total-coverage survey," "predictive modelling," "palaeoenvironmental data."
- Digital & technical: "digital field recording," "structured metadata," "FAIR data principles," "mobile data capture," "geospatial datasets."
- Research rigour: "analytical precision," "data provenance," "epistemological rigour," "methodological transparency."
- Collaboration: "collaborative," "multidisciplinary," "crowdsourcing," "stakeholder engagement."

Briefly clarify specialised terminology at first use unless writing explicitly for specialists:
"Although we initially considered universally unique identifiers (UUIDv4, as defined by RFC 4122), compatibility issues between our database (SQLite) and its geospatial extension (Spatialite) required simpler short integer identifiers."

## 3. Sentence and Paragraph Structure

### 3.1 Sentence Complexity and Length (Rating 3)
- Maintain variability in sentence length and complexity.
- Slightly reduce overly long or excessively complex sentences.
- Balance medium-length sentences (20–35 words) with shorter sentences for emphasis.

Example:  
"The biases and perverse incentives preregistration seeks to combat in other disciplines also exist in archaeology. Indeed, Processual archaeology, with its longstanding emphasis on transparency, explicit aims, and problem-orientation, has recognised these challenges for decades."

### 3.2 Paragraph Construction
- Clear topic sentences.
- Moderate paragraph length (approximately 100–200 words).
- Logical progression: introduction, supporting evidence, conclusion/transition.

---

## 4. Organisation and Logical Flow

### 4.1 Clear Signposting and Transitions (Rating 4)
- Explicitly introduce and summarise sections clearly.
- Logical transitions without being repetitive or overly simplified.

Example transition:  
"Having outlined the environmental context, we now examine the methodological framework underpinning our approach."

---

## 5. Nuanced Qualification and Integration of Detail (Rating 4)
- Maintain nuanced qualification to avoid rhetorical overconfidence.
- Integrate parenthetical clarifications smoothly within sentences rather than using parentheses frequently.
- Clearly express qualifications while maintaining readability.

Example:  
"Our approach required large datasets but did not depend on detailed understanding of degradation processes such as ploughing or looting, nor did it require projections of future agricultural or urban development."

---

## 6. Engaging Statements of Relevance and Significance (Rating 4, occasional use)
- Occasionally insert concise, engaging statements articulating broader relevance or significance.
- Scholarly tone, avoiding exaggerated claims or "hype."

Concise example:  
"These findings highlight the importance of balancing agricultural needs against protecting cultural heritage."

---

## 7. Directness and Concision (Rating 4)
- Use simpler, direct words or phrases when they convey the same meaning.
- Avoid unnecessary modifiers (adjectives, adverbs) and circumlocutions.
- Retain sufficient nuance to ensure scholarly accuracy.
- Ensure concision without making prose overly sparse or choppy.

Example:  
Original (wordy): "These findings highlight the practical importance of carefully balancing agricultural needs against the necessity of protecting irreplaceable cultural heritage."  
Preferred (concise): "These findings highlight the importance of balancing agricultural needs against protecting cultural heritage."

---

## 8. Overall Style Integration ("Vibe")
- Varied, sophisticated scholarly prose.
- Balance moderate complexity, concise phrasing, avoiding overly complex or overly sparse writing.
- Integrate qualifications smoothly, improving readability without sacrificing nuance or caution.
- Emphasise clear structure, logical flow, explicit signposting.
- Include occasional statements of relevance or significance, maintaining reader engagement without compromising academic rigour.
