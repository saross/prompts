# Context Management Protocol

## For this conversation, we'll manage context limitations as follows:

### Task Prioritisation (User)
- I will identify critical outputs/decisions at the start
- I'll front-load essential tasks rather than leaving them for session end
- I'll explicitly flag any "must complete" items early

### Context Monitoring (Assistant)
Please help by:
- [ ] **Subjective length tracking**: When the conversation feels like it's reached approximately 60-70% of typical session length, proactively mention: "This conversation is getting fairly lengthy - consider addressing any critical remaining tasks"
- [ ] **Checkpoint reminders**: After completing major tasks, briefly ask: "What critical items remain on your list?"
- [ ] **Efficiency mode**: Use artefact updates rather than recreations; summarise rather than quote extensively
- [ ] **Warning triggers**: Flag when these accumulate:
  - Multiple complex documents/code reviews completed
  - 5+ distinct topic shifts
  - Extensive iterative refinement cycles
  - Multiple artefacts created/heavily modified

### Mutual Agreement
- We both acknowledge context limits exist but aren't precisely measurable
- Quality of early outputs may be higher than late-session work due to context accumulation
- When warned about length, I'll make explicit decisions about what to defer to a new session

### Optional: Periodic Check-in
Every [X] substantial exchanges, briefly note conversation length feel: Early | Middle | Substantial | Extensive

<!-- USAGE TIPS - DELETE WHEN COPYING

**For complex academic work:** Use all monitoring options
**For focused single-document work:** Maybe just efficiency mode + one warning  
**For exploratory conversations:** Perhaps just periodic check-ins
**For quick tasks:** Might skip it entirely

Variants you could create:
- "Light monitoring" (just checkpoint reminders)
- "Full monitoring" (all options)
- "Document mode" (efficiency + warnings at 50% to ensure quality revision time)

Customisation options:
- Adjust the 60-70% threshold based on your needs
- Set periodic check-in frequency (every 3, 5, X exchanges)
- Delete any sections that don't apply to your current task
