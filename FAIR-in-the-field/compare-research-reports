I'm running an experiement today: I've asked all three frontier LLMs (you, ChatGPT, Gemini) to produce research reports on 'FAIR data from fieldwork'. I've attached all three of these reports to 'project knowledge'. Can you please: 1. Read all three reports. 2. Provide a comparison of strenghts, weaknesses, blind-spots, and insights. 3. Rank all three reports and provide reasoning. 4. Synthesise the insights from all three reports into a new, comprehensive report (as a markdown artefact).
