I am writing a paper on the production of FAIR data from fieldwork, particularly the steps that can be taken during field recording to stage data that is as FAIR as possible. I'd like to compare what I have now (see project knowledge) with international best practice in machine-actionable FAIR data, e.g., the WorldFAIR and FAIR Island projects. I'm particularly interested in archaeology and 'adjacent' disciplines like ecoloy and especially geoscience. My paper is a couple of years old and out of date (as well as being an incomplete draft). Can you run a research report to bring me up-to-date on machine-actionable FAIR data with a particular eye towards data arising from fieldwork? My expertise is in the creation and management of field data, so if I have a 'targe' - what machine-actionable FAIR data from fieldwork disciplines should ultimately look like - I can write a useful paper explaining how to get from point A (field data creation) to point B (publishable FAIR data). Please also look for weaknesses or blindspots in my paper and this prompt and point out anything important that I'm missing.
