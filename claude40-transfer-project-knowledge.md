I need to take a summary of the information about RAiD from this Project to another project. Could you please compose a detailed and specific summary of the 'Project knowledge', categorised into logical sections. You do not need to include anything related to documentation planning, focus on things that are intrinsic to RAiD (knowledge of future technical plans would be valuable though). Otherwise, elimiate redundancies but be thorough. Apply the 'writing style guide' (but do not consider its content when making the summary). As you produce the report, consider:

(1) I'd like you to consider yourself the main audience for this summary. You need a comprehensive understanding of the Project knowledge. We need to do things like produce documentation (of all types) and write proposals to for resourcing. Maximise utility to yourself. (2) Scope is comprehensive. Cover all of the categories you mention. Maximise the knowledge transfer from this project to others. (3) Structure should be human-readable, but you are the main audience. Do include a summary up front. (4) Use as much length as you need to extract information as thoroughly as possible without redundancy or duplication. Consider what you might need to know later, given that we don't know exactly what we need to do. (5) The report you are producing is for internal use; retain any sensitive information. Please produce your report as a markdown artefact.
