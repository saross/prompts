## Implementation Prompt for Subsection Change Plans

**Pre-implementation**: Confirm you have the approved change plan for Section [3.4] *and* to the latest target document 'Section [X]: [Title] (Updated...).md' in Project Knowledge.

**Document**: Update 'Section [X]: [Title] (Updated...).md' in Project Knowledge, changing title to '(Updated through Section [X.X])'

**Implementation**:
1. Execute the complete change plan for the target subsection
2. Standardise terminology throughout the ENTIRE section (not just the subsection being revised)
3. Apply any other improvements identified during review to other subsections
4. Preserve all content except where explicitly directed to remove/replace

**Defer**: Updates to other documents (tracking files, cross-references) â€“ remember them; address systematically later

**Principle**: Create a cumulative, authoritative section document with consistent terminology and comprehensive updates.
