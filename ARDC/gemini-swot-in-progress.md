Hi Gemini,

We are in a live SWOT analysis session. Attached is a PNG export of our collaborative whiteboard. Please analyze it according to the steps below. The output should be clear, human-readable, and suitable for immediate discussion among participants.

**Instructions for Real-Time Analysis:**

**Part 1: Quadrant Content & Themes**

For each of the four main SWOT quadrants visible (**Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats**), and also for any of the four strategic TOWS matrix quadrants if they have content (**SO: Opportunities/Strengths, ST: Threats/Strengths, WO: Opportunities/Weaknesses, WT: Threats/Weaknesses**), please:

1. **Transcribe:** List all legible sticky notes within that specific quadrant. Present these as bullet points under a clear heading for the quadrant (e.g., "**STRENGTHS:**").  
2. **Summarize Patterns:** After transcribing the notes for a quadrant, provide a brief summary (1-3 bullet points) of the key themes, recurring ideas, or notable patterns you observe *within that individual quadrant*.

**Part 2: Overall Analysis & Strategic Insights**

After completing Part 1 for all visible quadrants:

3. **Summarize Key Outcomes:** Provide an overall summary (3-5 bullet points) of the most significant strategic outcomes, insights, or critical points that emerge when considering the entire board (all transcribed SWOT and TOWS elements together). What are the most pressing issues or biggest leverage points apparent from this snapshot?  
4. **Identify Strong Linkages:** Highlight any particularly strong or direct linkages you observe between specific items in different quadrants (e.g., 'Strength X seems to directly counter Threat Y,' or 'Weakness A severely limits our ability to pursue Opportunity B').  
5. **Flag Quick Wins/Critical Concerns:** Based on your analysis, point out any items or combinations that might represent potential 'quick wins' (e.g., easily leveraged strengths for clear opportunities) or 'critical concerns' (e.g., significant weaknesses directly exposed to major threats).  
6. **Note Dominant Overall Theme/Sentiment:** What is the overall dominant theme or sentiment you perceive emerging from the entire board (e.g., largely optimistic, focused on overcoming internal challenges, urgently needing to address external pressures)?  
7. **Identify Points Needing Clarification:** Are there any specific sticky notes that appear particularly vague, ambiguous, or seem to require further clarification from the team to be fully understood or actionable?  
8. **Highlight Contradictions/Tensions:** Do you notice any points on the board that appear to contradict each other or highlight a significant internal tension that the team might need to discuss?

**Part 3: (Experimental) Suggest Strategic Actions**

Based *only* on the content you have transcribed from the **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats** quadrants in Part 1, please suggest potential strategies for the following. If there isn't enough specific information in the base quadrants to reasonably inform a particular strategy type, please indicate that.

* **SO Strategies (Opportunities through Strengths):** How can we leverage our \[identified Strengths\] to capitalize on the \[identified Opportunities\]? (Suggest 1-2 potential strategies)  
* **ST Strategies (Threats through Strengths):** How can we use our \[identified Strengths\] to mitigate or overcome the \[identified Threats\]? (Suggest 1-2 potential strategies)  
* **WO Strategies (Opportunities to minimize Weaknesses):** How can we address our \[identified Weaknesses\] by taking advantage of the \[identified Opportunities\]? (Suggest 1-2 potential strategies)  
* **WT Strategies (Threats and Weaknesses):** What actions can we take to minimize our \[identified Weaknesses\] and avoid the \[identified Threats\]? (Suggest 1-2 potential strategies)

**Output Format for Real-Time Discussion:**

* Please use clear headings for each part and sub-section (e.g., "PART 1: QUADRANT CONTENT & THEMES", "STRENGTHS:", "Patterns in Strengths:", "PART 2: OVERALL ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC INSIGHTS", "PART 3: SUGGESTED STRATEGIC ACTIONS", "SO Strategies:").  
* Use bullet points extensively for lists and summaries to ensure readability.  
* Aim for conciseness while capturing the essence of the notes and patterns.

**Important Note:** This prompt is for intermittent analysis during the workshop. Each PNG is a snapshot.

Thank you\!
