# Prompt for Updating "Changes to RAiD Structure and Content Coverage Analysis"

We have completed Section [X.X]. Please update the 'Changes to RAiD Structure and Content Coverage Analysis' document to capture meaningful differences between planned and implemented content. 

**Important**: If this document doesn't exist in project knowledge, create a new one titled "Changes to RAiD Structure and Content Coverage Analysis (Section [X])". This document accumulates changes throughout Section [X] development and will be removed after applying updates to the master structure document.

**Cumulative Rule**: Add new changes without removing existing content unless explicitly superseded. Work directly in the markdown artifact, not in chat.

## 1. Document Changes
Compare original plan to implementation using this format:

### Structure & Content
**Format**: Current → Change To + Rationale + **Priority (High/Medium/Low)**

Document:
- Subsection additions/removals/reordering
- Content scope changes (expanded/condensed/deferred)
- New patterns established (e.g., Future Enhancements sections)
- Topics relocated to other sections [specify target: Section X.X]
- Terminology standardisations applied

### Operational Impact
Specify update frequency in parentheses:

**New Maintenance Requirements**:
- Item requiring updates (Quarterly/Semi-Annual/Annual)
- Cross-reference dependencies: "Section X.X must..."
- External documentation dependencies: [document name - status]

### Process Insights
**What Worked**:
- Effective techniques/patterns discovered
- Successful approaches to reuse

**Challenges & Solutions**:
- Problem: [description]
- Solution: [approach taken]

**Future Recommendations**:
- Patterns to apply in subsequent sections
- Process improvements identified

## 2. Priority Classification
Assign priorities to help with later implementation:
- **High**: Structural changes, cross-reference requirements, maintenance schedules
- **Medium**: Content enhancements, process improvements, clarifications  
- **Low**: Minor adjustments, future considerations, nice-to-haves

## 3. Summary
**Format**: Section [X.X] implementation [key action: transformed/expanded/clarified] [what] through [approach]. The [most significant change] provides [key benefit]. [Notable pattern/learning] for future sections.

## 4. Implementation Notes
At document end, maintain:
- Current status: "Accumulating changes for Section [X]"
- Sections completed: [X.1 ✓, X.2 ✓, etc.]
- Last updated: [date]

**Focus on**: Changes affecting structure, maintenance burden, cross-references, or establishing patterns. Skip routine elaborations or minor wording improvements.
