# For Final Section Review:

Before we close Section [X.X], please conduct a final review:

1. Verify all agreed changes have been implemented correctly
2. Check for consistency in terminology and style
3. **Verify factual accuracy**: Ensure all content describes RAiD's current state unless explicitly marked as future/planned/recommended.
4. Content you recommend and that we agree is desirable and aspirational should be contained in a 'Future Enhancements' section.
5. Ensure section flows logically and serves its intended audience
6. Suggest 2-3 potential enhancements for future consideration (without implementing them)
7. Confirm the section adequately addresses its stated objectives
8. Flag any aspirational content that may have inadvertently been presented as current functionality
9. Ensure no content contradicts 'RAiD Documentation Clarifications and Updates (Updated...).md' (in project knowledge), which contains crucial updates or clarifications to other project knowledge.
