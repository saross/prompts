# Comprehensive Change Plan Creation

Following our review and clarification discussion for Section [X.X]: [Section Title], please create a comprehensive change plan using these specifications:

## Change Plan Requirements

### 1. Format and Structure
- Organise changes by the current section's existing structure (e.g., "Technical Foundation", "Distinguishing Characteristics", etc.)
- For each subsection requiring changes, provide:
  - **Current text**: Quote the existing paragraph(s) that need modification
  - **Replace with**: Provide the complete replacement text including ALL details discussed
- Clearly mark any new subsections to be added
- Use markdown formatting for the entire change plan

### 2. Content Guidelines
- **Length**: We have NO length restrictions - include every detail I provided during clarification
- **Completeness**: Do not summarise, truncate, or paraphrase the information given
- **Accuracy**: Include specific dates, technical details, examples, and all clarifications exactly as discussed
- **Preservation**: Maintain all valuable existing content unless I explicitly directed its removal
- **Scope**: Do not add any new information beyond what we discussed in Phases 1 and 2
- **Terminology**: Apply agreed terminology consistently throughout all changes

### 3. Specific Elements to Include
- Full paragraph replacements (not just bullet points of changes)
- All technical specifications, dates, and examples mentioned
- Proper terminology as clarified (e.g., "partial subset of metadata" not "core metadata")
- Any governance details, partnership information, or operational aspects discussed
- Clear distinction between current capabilities and future/aspirational features

### 4. Additional Documentation Updates
At the end of the change plan, list:
- **Items to update in 'RAiD Documentation Clarifications and Updates.md'**: Note any terminology corrections, clarifications, or important distinctions that should be documented for future reference
- **Cross-references**: Any mentions of this content in other sections that may need updating

### 5. Final Review Questions
After presenting the complete change plan, ask:
- Are there any aspects of the change plan that need further clarification?
- Have I accurately captured all the details you provided?
- Are there any additional changes you'd like to include before we proceed to implementation?
