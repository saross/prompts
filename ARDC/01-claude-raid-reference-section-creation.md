# Initial Section Creation Prompt for RAiD Reference Documentation

Hi Claude,

I need you to create an initial draft of **Section [X]: [Section Title]** for the RAiD Reference Documentation.

## Context:
The RAiD Reference Documentation serves primarily as an **LLM-intermediated resource** – users will upload it to Large Language Models to ask questions about RAiD. Therefore, documentation must be comprehensive, self-contained within sections, explicitly detailed, and structured for accurate LLM information retrieval. 

Review completed sections in project knowledge to understand established patterns and terminology.

## Your Task:
Generate the first draft of this specific section based on comprehensive searches of project knowledge.

## Process:

### 1. Review Structure
Examine the 'RAiD Reference Documentation Structure' document to understand:
- Section [X]'s exact scope, purpose, and subsections
- Its relationships to other sections
- Expected detail level for LLM comprehension

### 2. Comprehensive Search
Conduct multiple targeted searches of project knowledge:
- Use varied search terms and synonyms
- Find technical specifications, examples, edge cases, procedures, and implementation details
- Capture both explicit information and implied context

### 3. Content Organisation
Structure findings according to the section template, ensuring you:
- **Document current reality**: Focus on RAiD's existing features and capabilities
- **Label aspirational content** consistently:
  - `[PLANNED]` – confirmed future features
  - `[UNDER CONSIDERATION]` – proposed enhancements
  - `[RECOMMENDATION]` – unimplemented best practices
- Include comprehensive technical details and concrete examples
- Provide sufficient standalone context for each concept
- Integrate relevant value propositions naturally where they enhance understanding

### 4. Draft Creation
Write following:
- 'Academic Eloquence' style guide (formal scholarly tone, Australian/UK conventions, varied phrasing, avoiding casual contractions)
- Professional technical documentation standards
- Hierarchical structure with numbered headings
- Logical flow from foundational concepts to implementations
- Explicit definitions for all technical terms and acronyms
- Review terminology used in previous sections to maintain consistency
- Note any terminology standardisations (e.g., "component" not "function")
- Verify any cross-references from previous sections that point to this section
- Ensure promised content is delivered

## Key Requirements:

### Audience:
**Primary**: LLMs processing user queries | **Secondary**: Technical implementers | **Tertiary**: Evaluating stakeholders

### Specifications:
- **Scope**: Section [X] only – maintain boundaries
- **Completeness**: Extract all relevant information while maintaining focus
- **Accuracy**: Current functionality first; clearly distinguish future plans
- **Cross-references**: "See Section Y.Z: [Section Title]" format
- **Technical Depth**: Include APIs, data structures, specifications where relevant

### LLM Optimisation:
- Write explicitly, not implicitly
- Include context preventing misinterpretation
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Structure for easy extraction and synthesis
- Clearly delineate information types (factual/procedural/conceptual)

## Output:
Create a markdown artifact containing Section [X]'s complete initial draft with:
- Proper markdown hierarchy
- Section overview introduction
- All specified subsections
- Sufficient detail for standalone comprehension

Please be sure to consult 'RAiD Documentation Clarifications and Updates (Updated...).md' (in project knowledge), which contains crucial updates or clarifications to other project knowledge. This document overrides other information in project knowledge where there is a conflict.

Begin immediately with Section [X]: [Section Title].
