# Prompt for Updating Master Structure Document from Accumulated Changes

Now that we have finished Section [N], please update the "RAiD Reference Documentation Structure and Content Coverage Analysis.md" using accumulated changes from section implementations.

## 1. Access Source Documents
- Review "Changes to RAiD Structure and Content Coverage Analysis.md" 
- Note priority levels (High/Medium/Low) for implementation order
- Identify any patterns or themes in the changes (e.g., terminology standardisation)

## 2. Apply Changes
Process each change using format: **Current → Change To** + Rationale

**Change Categories:**
- Structural Changes (reorganisation, new subsections)
- Content Enhancements (expanded descriptions)
- Process Updates (including review methodology updates)
- New Sections/Maintenance Items/Cross-References
- Terminology Updates (standardisation across document)
- Minor Corrections

**Implementation Order:**
1. Apply High Priority changes first
2. Apply terminology standardisation globally where applicable
3. Preserve all content unless marked for removal
4. Maintain section numbering and cross-reference consistency
5. When adding maintenance schedules, consolidate all items by frequency

## 3. Version Control
- Check for existing version history
- If none exists, create one showing progression
- Update version number (v1.0 → v1.1 → etc.)
- Add document status indicator (e.g., "Updated through Section X")
- Add last updated date and next review milestone

## 4. Produce Summary Report

### Changes Applied by Category
- List each category with count and brief description of changes
- Use checkmarks (✓) to indicate completion
- Note priority level for each change applied

### Changes Deferred
- List any deferred changes with specific reasons
- Include plan for future implementation if applicable

### Version Update
- Previous version: [number]
- Current version: [number]
- Key improvements in this version (bullet list)

### Document Integrity Confirmation
Verify and report:
- ✓ Structure maintained
- ✓ Cross-references consistent
- ✓ Content preserved (except where directed)
- ✓ Coherence verified
- ✓ Prioritisation respected

### Key Improvements
- Summarise 3-5 most significant improvements made

## 5. Quality Checks
- Verify all HIGH priority items were addressed
- Confirm maintenance schedule is comprehensive
- Validate that GitHub repository reference is included
- Ensure conclusion section remains intact
- Check that all section number references are accurate

**Key Principles**: 
- Use the Changes document as authoritative source
- Apply changes exactly as specified while ensuring coherence
- When changes affect multiple locations, apply globally
- Maintain document's narrative flow and readability
