Hi Claude,

I need to take a **comprehensive summary** of the 'Project knowledge' about RAiD from this Project to another Project. 

Could you please compose a comprehensive, detailed, and specific summary of all 'Project knowledge', categorised into logical sections. Focus on things that are intrinsic to RAiD (including knowledge of future documentation, policy, governance, and technical plans). Otherwise, elimiate redundancies but be very thorough. 

Apply the 'writing style guide' (but do not consider its content when making the summary). 

As you produce the report, consider: 

1. I'd like you to consider yourself the main audience for this summary. You need a complete  understanding of the Project Knowledge. We need to do things like produce documentation (of all types) and write proposals to for resourcing. Maximise utility to yourself. 
2. Scope is comprehensive. Cover all of the categories you derive. Maximise the knowledge transfer from this project to others. 
3. Structure should be human-readable, but you are the main audience. Do include a summary and guide to the document up front. 
4. Use as much time and length as you need to extract information as thoroughly as possible without redundancy or duplication. Consider what you might need to know later, given that we don't know exactly what we need to do with this information yet.
5. The report you are producing is for internal use; retain any sensitive information. 

Please produce your report as a markdown artefact.
