# For Tracking and Maintenance:

As we complete Section [X], please:
1. List any items added to the "Content Requiring Regular Updates" maintenance list
2. Identify cross-references to other sections that need verification
3. Note any topics deferred to later sections
4. Flag any project knowledge gaps discovered that need to be filled

# For Final Section Review:

Before we close Section [X], please conduct a final review:

1. Verify all agreed changes have been implemented correctly
2. Check for consistency in terminology and style
3. **Verify factual accuracy**: Ensure all content describes RAiD's current state unless explicitly marked as future/planned/recommended.
4. Content you recommend and that we agree is desirable and aspirational should be contained in a 'Future Enhancements' section.
5. Ensure section flows logically and serves its intended audience
6. Suggest 2-3 potential enhancements for future consideration (without implementing them)
7. Confirm the section adequately addresses its stated objectives
8. Flag any aspirational content that may have inadvertently been presented as current functionality

# For Complex Sections with Multiple Subsections:

Section [X] contains multiple subsections. Would you prefer to:
1. Review all subsections together in one comprehensive analysis, or
2. Take each subsection individually for more focused discussion?

[If option 2]: Let's begin with subsection [X.1]. Please follow the standard review process but focused only on this subsection.

# Prompt for Updating the RAiD Reference Documentation Structure Document

I need to update the "RAiD Knowledge Base Structure and Content Coverage Analysis.md" document in project knowledge based on refinements made during Section 1 development. 

Please:
1. Locate and review the "Changes to RAiD Structure and Content Coverage Analysis" document in project knowledge, which details all necessary updates
2. Apply these changes systematically to the main structure document, including:
   - Terminology updates (Knowledge Base â†’ Reference Documentation)
   - Section 1 structural refinements (now 5 subsections including "Get Involved")
   - User category adjustments (separated Funders/Policy Makers, added Infrastructure Providers)
   - Expanded terminology section with categorical organisation
   - Process improvements including three-phase review methodology
3. Preserve all existing content except where explicitly noted for change
4. Maintain the document's academic tone and structural integrity

After implementing changes, please provide a brief summary confirming which updates were successfully applied.

# Prompt for Updating the Progress Tracking Document

I need to update the "RAiD Reference Documentation - Progress Tracking and Task List.md" based on our completion of Section 1 (version 15).

Please:
1. Review the current progress tracking document in project knowledge
2. Update Section 1 status to reflect:
   - All five subsections completed (including new Section 1.5 "Get Involved")
   - Key additions: UK/EOSC recognition, clarified RAiD System vs Service, expanded terminology
   - Infrastructure Providers added as distinct user category
   - Process refinements established (three-phase review, subsection-by-subsection approach)
3. Note any deferred items (e.g., University of Notre Dame Australia example for later sections)
4. Update the "Process Refinements" section with our established workflow
5. Prepare the document for Section 2 work

Maintain all existing tracking information whilst adding these updates. The document version should reflect v15 for Section 1.
