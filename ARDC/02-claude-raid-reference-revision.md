Hi Claude,

You and I are continuing work on the RAiD Reference Documentation. We are now working on Section [3.5]. 

Please follow this systematic process:

## Phase 1: Initial Content Review
1. First, briefly confirm you can access the current documentation artifact for the entire Section (Section [X]: [Section Title]) and identify what content already exists for this section
2. Conduct a **comprehensive** search of project knowledge relevant to Section [X], using multiple targeted searches to ensure thorough coverage; briefly name *key* sources in project knowledge
3. Generate a structured review report containing:
   - **Current State Content**: Factual information about RAiD's existing features, capabilities, and processes (e.g., "RAiD currently uses synchronous APIs")
   - **Additions/Elaborations**: New content from project knowledge that should be incorporated (e.g., "Technical specification found but not yet documented")
   - **Clarifications/Refinements**: Existing content that could be improved based on project knowledge
   - **Contradictions**: Any conflicts between current content and project knowledge (or within project knowledge itself)
   - **Missing Information**: Gaps where we lack necessary information in project knowledge
   - **Aspirational Content**: Identify any content that describes future plans, recommendations, or "should have" features rather than current reality; mark all such content clearly using consistent terminology, or place in a dedicated section.
   - **Structure and Organisation**: Suggest changes to the structure of Section [X] that reduce redundancy, improve consistency, and optimise the section for later use by LLMs.

## Phase 2: Interactive Refinement
After presenting your findings, wait for my responses before making any changes. I will:
- Answer your questions about contradictions or ambiguities
- Clarify what is current vs. planned/aspirational
- Provide additional context where needed
- Indicate which suggestions to implement
- Add new ideas prompted by your review

## Key Principles
- **Document current reality first**: Focus on what RAiD currently is and does, not what it might become
- **Distinguish aspirational content**: If future plans must be mentioned, clearly mark them as "planned", "under consideration", or place in "future enhancement" section - including changes or extensions *you* recommend (and that we agree on). Reference Section 10.6 (Development Roadmap) for detailed future plans
- **Verify with project knowledge**: Base all claims about current functionality on documented evidence
- **Ask when uncertain**: If unclear whether something is current or planned, flag for clarification
- Be thorough but concise in your review findings
- Group similar items for easier discussion
- Provide brief rationales for significant suggestions
- Flag any cross-references that may need updating
- Note items that might be better suited for other sections

Pay special attention to 'RAiD Documentation Clarifications and Updates (Updated).md', which contains important information about superceded or incorrect information elsewhere in the project knowledge.

Do not begin making changes until we've completed the review and discussion phases.

When Phase 2 is complete, I will provide a prompt for creating a comprehensive change plan.
