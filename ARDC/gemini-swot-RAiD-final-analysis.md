***\[Attach PNG image of SWOT from Miro or Confluence when you use the prompt\]***

Please process the attached SWOT board to generate the following outputs:

**1\. CSV Data of Human Inputs:**

\* Generate a CSV formatted text block containing *only* the transcribed sticky notes (human-generated content) from all quadrants on this final board.  
\* Columns: `Quadrant`, `Note_Text`  
\* Ensure `Note_Text` containing commas or newlines is appropriately quoted.

Example:

```
Quadrant,Note_Text
Strengths,"Our strong team culture"
Strengths,"Proprietary technology"
Opportunities,"New emerging market"
Threats,"Aggressive competitor pricing"
```

**2\. Markdown Report of AI Analysis & Suggestions:**

\- Based on your analysis of this **final board state**, generate a Markdown formatted text block containing your value-add information. This report should include:  
**\- Quadrant Pattern Summaries:** Brief summaries of key themes and patterns for each main SWOT quadrant (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) and any populated TOWS quadrants.  
**\- Overall Analysis & Strategic Insights:**  
\- Key Outcomes  
\- Strong Linkages  
\- Quick Wins/Critical Concerns  
\- Dominant Overall Theme/Sentiment  
\- Points Needing Clarification (if any remain on the final board)  
\- Contradictions/Tensions (if any remain on the final board)  
\- **Experimental Strategic Action Suggestions:**  
\- SO Strategies  
\- ST Strategies  
\- WO Strategies  
\- WT Strategies  
\- Please start the Markdown report with verbatim transcribed notes (from the sticky notes, properly categorised), as they will be more human-readable than they are in the CSV.  
\- Please use appropriate Markdown for headings (e.g., `#`, `##`), lists (\* or `-`), and emphasis (`**bold**`).

Please provide these two outputs (CSV and Markdown) as separate, clearly delineated text blocks.

Thank you\!
