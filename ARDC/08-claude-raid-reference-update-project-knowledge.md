## Documenting Crucial Updates

Please review our conversation for clarifications that supersede project knowledge and *append* them to the latest 'RAiD Documentation Clarifications and Updates (Updated through Section [X.X]).md' that you can find in the Project Knowledge. This is a cumulative document; do not discard existing information unless it is explicitly superceded.

**Capture**:
- Corrections to outdated/inaccurate information
- Current vs planned functionality distinctions
- Technical specifications requiring temporal qualification
- Terminology standardisation decisions
- Integration status updates

**Document thematically** with:
- Brief context explaining the clarification
- Current accurate state
- Implications for consistency

**Update**: Document title and version history.

Please be sure to preview consolidated changes to me first for approval before writing to the document.
