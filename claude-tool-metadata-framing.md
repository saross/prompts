Hi Claude, we are going to be collecting evidence for a research paper about 'research software tools' in archaeology, history, and other historical studies disciplines. Specifically, we want to assemble metadata about specific software tools. Please use the nearby detailed prompt to begin the process. 

A **Writing Style Guide** is attached to this Project, please apply it to your report and the CSV. 

Please always follow the following **Title Conventions** when you generate your report
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Format & Structure**: For the title of your Report (including within the report itself), use "[Tool Name]: [Primary Function] for [Application Domain]" template

I need to ensure consistency across many runs of this prompt, so please do not ask follow-up questions, simply execute the prompt. Consult the 'Tool disambiguation' section in particular if you have questions about the exact tool you are investigating.

Confirm that you understand, then I will provide you with the name or acronym of the first tool.
