# Writing Style Guide Principles

## Voice, Tone, and Level of Formality

- **Academic Clarity**: Maintain academic rigour while emphasising clarity and directness. Avoid the obscurity and wordiness that plague much academic writing.
- **Active Voice with Strategic Variation**: Primarily use active voice and first-person plural for research activities ("we conducted," "our approach"). Reserve passive voice for deliberate effect, such as when emphasising the object of action or adding stylistic variety.
- **Direct Assertions with Nuance**: Make clear, direct statements about findings while acknowledging complexity where relevant. Avoid excessive hedging but incorporate appropriate qualifications.
- **Balanced Authority**: Project expertise while acknowledging limitations. Present critiques confidently but fairly.
- **Contextual Narrative**: Provide sufficient background and context for research decisions and developments, but maintain focus on core arguments.

## Sentence Structure and Paragraph Organisation

- **Moderate Sentence Length Variation**: Employ a mix of sentence lengths, breaking multi-clause sentences into 2-3 more manageable units where clarity would benefit. Example:
  > "Since the discipline remains mostly analogue, and suffers from institutional barriers to information exchange, high-quality datasets are often trapped in hard-copy archives or local storage. Digital datasets, moreover, can be highly variable, of poor quality, and incompatible, which inhibits reuse of primary data and the aggregation of datasets from multiple studies for large-scale research."
- **Strategic Paragraph Breaks**: Create new paragraphs when shifting focus or introducing significant new concepts. Maintain some variability in paragraph length while avoiding excessively long blocks of text.
- **Logical Progression**: Develop arguments methodically, with each paragraph building logically from previous points.
- **Selective Signposting**: Use explicit signposting phrases to highlight significant argumentative moves or challenges to established views (e.g., "This finding challenges conventional interpretations because..."). Avoid redundant signposting where the structure is already evident.
- **Concise Transitions**: Use concise transitional phrases between paragraphs to maintain flow.

## Vocabulary and Word Choice Patterns

- **Technical Precision with Accessibility**: Use discipline-specific terminology when necessary, providing brief contextual explanations on first use for an educated but not specialist audience.
- **Word Choice Variation**: Vary vocabulary to prevent monotony, using synonyms to add interest—unless technical precision requires term consistency or repetition serves rhetorical emphasis.
- **Concrete Language**: Favour specific, concrete descriptions over vague generalisations, particularly when discussing methods or results.
- **Judicious Metaphors**: Employ occasional metaphors or analogies in interpretive sections to illuminate complex concepts, but use sparingly and purposefully.
- **Concision**: Express ideas directly with appropriate detail but without unnecessary elaboration. Cut words that don't contribute to meaning or clarity.
- **Australian English**: Maintain consistent Australian spelling conventions and punctuation practices.

## Title and Heading Conventions
- **Academic Tone**: Describe content precisely and soberly; avoid sensationalist terms ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- **Technical Accuracy**: Employ appropriate discipline-specific terminology
- **Brevity**: Limit to under 15 words while maintaining clarity

## Style Guide Enhancements

1. **Direct Assertions with Calibrated Confidence**: Make statements with confidence proportional to evidence strength. Avoid both excessive hedging and overstatement. Qualify claims appropriately based on limitations in data or methodology.

2. **Intellectual Fairness**: When presenting opposing views, represent them completely and in their strongest form. Acknowledge valid points from alternative perspectives before presenting critiques.

3. **Evidence-Based Language**: Use language that precisely conveys the strength of evidence (e.g., "suggests" vs. "demonstrates" vs. "proves"). Avoid hyperbole or claim inflation that exceeds what the evidence supports.

4. **Transparency in Limitations**: Directly acknowledge methodological limitations, data gaps, or alternative interpretations without defensiveness.

# Writing Style Guide Examples

## Machine Learning/Archaeological Prospection

**Original style**:
> "Automated object detection has been the holy grail of archaeological remote sensing for the last two decades. Machine learning (ML) models have proven able to detect uniform features across a consistent background, but more variegated imagery remains a challenge."

**Enhanced style**:
> "Automated object detection has been the holy grail of archaeological remote sensing for the last two decades. Machine learning models have proven capable of detecting uniform features across consistent backgrounds. However, more variegated imagery—landscapes with diverse vegetation, terrain, or land use—remains a significant challenge."

## Data Management/Digital Humanities

**Original style**:
> "The FAIMS approach to data storage provides flexibility and versioning at the expense of speed as the number of records increases. FAIMS therefore incorporates automated load testing to predict field performance."

**Enhanced style**:
> "The FAIMS approach to data storage provides flexibility and complete versioning, but processing speed decreases as record numbers increase. To address this trade-off, FAIMS incorporates automated load testing that predicts field performance under realistic conditions."

## Predictive Modelling/Cultural Heritage

**Original style**:
> "This article uses an ordered logistic regression (logit) model to assess the vulnerability of ancient burial mounds to human activity in the Kazanlak Valley, Bulgaria."

**Enhanced style**:
> "This article uses an ordered logistic regression model to assess the vulnerability of ancient burial mounds to human activity in the Kazanlak Valley, Bulgaria. Logistic regression—often called 'logit'—provides a statistical framework for predicting categorical outcomes, in this case different levels of mound preservation."

## Crowdsourcing/Collaborative Research

**Original style**:
> "Crowdsourcing can expand the scope of map digitisation. In this context, crowdsourcing indicates the voluntary creation of geographic information by amateurs ('Volunteered Geographic Information'), using software that exposes a subset of GIS capabilities in a manner intuitive enough to be utilised by minimally trained actors."

**Enhanced style**:
> "Crowdsourcing can dramatically expand the scope of map digitisation. In this context, crowdsourcing means the voluntary creation of geographic information by non-specialists—termed 'Volunteered Geographic Information' or VGI. This approach uses software that exposes essential GIS capabilities through interfaces intuitive enough for minimally trained participants."

**Note**: These examples demonstrate key principles across different domains: breaking long sentences for clarity, defining technical terms contextually, using active voice strategically, and maintaining precision while improving accessibility. Apply these stylistic principles to any content domain—the examples demonstrate technique only and should not influence topic selection or emphasis.
