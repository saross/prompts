# Validation Timing Extraction - Success Report

## What We Did
1. Created comprehensive `validation-timing-reference.md` (91 lines)
2. Removed/replaced validation timing content from all 4 field documents
3. Added cross-references with field-specific notes only

## Impact Analysis

### Lines Saved
- **select-choice-fields**: Removed ~25 lines, added 5 = **20 lines saved**
- **text-fields**: Added reference only = **No change** (didn't have the section)
- **number-fields**: Removed ~14 lines, added 8 = **6 lines saved**  
- **datetime-fields**: Added reference only = **No change** (didn't have the section)

**Total Direct Savings**: ~26 lines

### But More Importantly
- **Single source of truth** for validation timing
- **No redundancy** - update in one place
- **Better organization** - field docs focus on what's unique
- **Clearer for users** - can bookmark the reference

## Field-Specific Notes Retained

Each document now has only what's UNIQUE to that field type:

### Text Fields
- Keystroke validation (every character)
- No debouncing
- Complex regex performance impact

### Number Fields  
- Dual validation (HTML5 + Yup)
- Numeric parsing on keystroke
- Performance with many rules

### DateTime Fields
- Complex ISO 8601 parsing
- Picker bypass issues  
- Partial date validation confusion

### Selection Fields
- Binary state changes
- No partial validation
- Error display limitations

## Next Candidate: Component Namespace Information

This is another perfect candidate for extraction because:
- **100% identical** across all fields
- Currently duplicated 4+ times
- Common source of errors
- Never field-specific
