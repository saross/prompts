# Future Tasks and Maintenance Plan

**Created**: 2025-01-07  
**Purpose**: Consolidated list of future enhancements and maintenance tasks  
**Status**: Post-LLM optimization project completion

## Context

Following the successful completion of the LLM optimization project (95/100 score achieved), this document consolidates all remaining and future tasks for the Fieldmark documentation system. These tasks focus on content enhancement, maintenance, and continuous improvement rather than structural changes.

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Production Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Test notebook generation with optimized reference.md**
  - Generate 5+ different notebook types
  - Validate parametric template system
  - Document any generation failures
  - Priority: **HIGH** - Critical for validation

- [ ] **Monitor LLM performance metrics**
  - Track generation accuracy
  - Measure response times
  - Collect error patterns
  - Priority: **HIGH** - Ongoing

### 2. Content Enhancement

#### JSON Examples Expansion
- [ ] **Add 15-20 production-ready examples per field doc**
  - Media fields: FileUploader validation, TakePhoto workflows
  - Location fields: MapFormField configs, TakePoint accuracy
  - Relationship field: Complex vocabulary pairs, nested structures
  - Display field: Markdown structures, conditional display
  - Total needed: ~60-80 examples
  - Priority: **HIGH** - Direct user impact

#### Platform-Specific Documentation
- [ ] **Expand platform behaviors**
  - iOS: HEIC conversion, permission handling
  - Android: Storage permissions, camera access
  - Web: File size limits, browser constraints
  - PWA: Offline capabilities, sync behavior
  - Priority: **MEDIUM**

#### Troubleshooting Expansion
- [ ] **Enhance troubleshooting coverage**
  - Memory exhaustion scenarios
  - Permission recovery workflows
  - Sync failure patterns
  - Add 5-10 rows to Quick Diagnosis tables
  - Priority: **MEDIUM**

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Reviews
- [ ] **Monthly: Designer limitations review**
  - Check for new Designer features/fixes
  - Update constraints-reference.md
  - Verify component mappings still accurate

- [ ] **Quarterly: Migration strategies update**
  - Review migration patterns effectiveness
  - Add new migration scenarios
  - Update based on user feedback

- [ ] **As needed: Security advisories**
  - Monitor for new security issues
  - Update immediately when found
  - Priority: **HIGH** when applicable

### Documentation Quality
- [ ] **Cross-reference verification**
  - Verify all internal links work
  - Test bidirectional navigation
  - Check anchor consistency
  - Priority: **LOW** - Already mostly verified

- [ ] **Performance metrics updates**
  - Replace estimates with real measurements
  - GPS acquisition times by platform
  - Map tile cache sizes
  - Battery drain metrics
  - Priority: **LOW** - When data available

## Enhancement Opportunities

### Cookbook Expansion
- [ ] **Add more parametric recipes**
  - Based on common user patterns
  - Complex validation scenarios
  - Advanced conditional logic
  - Multi-step workflows

### Glossary Updates
- [ ] **Expand terminology as needed**
  - New features/components
  - User-suggested terms
  - Platform-specific terminology

### Template Library Growth
- [ ] **Create specialized notebook templates**
  - Industry-specific templates
  - Advanced feature demonstrations
  - Best practice showcases

## Optional Improvements

### Accessibility Documentation
- [ ] **Document accessibility workarounds**
  - Screen reader alternatives for RichText
  - ARIA attribute injection attempts
  - RTL text handling
  - Keyboard navigation patterns

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] **Create "lite" reference version**
  - Essential content only (<15K lines)
  - Faster LLM processing
  - Mobile-optimized size

### Migration Guides
- [ ] **Detailed migration paths**
  - Between old/new field approaches
  - Field type conversion guidance
  - Data preservation strategies

## Completed Milestones (Archived)

- ✅ All 5 phases completed successfully
- ✅ Score: 95/100 achieved
- ✅ 1,509 template markers added
- ✅ Comprehensive glossary created
- ✅ Troubleshooting index with 95% coverage
- ✅ 5 working notebook templates
- ✅ 10 parametric cookbook recipes

### Documentation Architecture (2025-01-06)

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure ongoing success:

1. **Notebook Generation Success Rate**
   - Target: >95%
   - Current: TBD (needs testing)

2. **Error Resolution Speed**
   - Target: <2 minutes average
   - Current: TBD (needs measurement)

3. **Documentation Currency**
   - Target: <30 days lag from feature release
   - Current: Up to date

4. **User Satisfaction**
   - Target: >4.5/5 rating
   - Current: TBD (needs feedback)

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Test notebook generation with real use cases
2. Collect initial performance metrics
3. Document any discovered issues

### Short Term (This Month)
1. Add high-priority JSON examples
2. Expand troubleshooting based on test results
3. Update cookbook with discovered patterns

### Long Term (Quarterly)
1. Review and update all documentation
2. Expand templates based on usage
3. Optimize based on performance data

## Notes

- Structural work is complete - focus on content
- Prioritize based on user impact
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Keep reference.md under 35K lines
- Always test changes with actual generation
