## Overview {essential}

Fieldmark implements a three-tier permission model with role inheritance and virtual role mapping. Understanding this system is essential for project administration and user management.

### Permission Hierarchy {essential}
```
Global Roles (System-wide)
    ↓
Team Roles (Per team)
    ↓
Notebook Roles (Per notebook/project)
```

### Key Concepts {essential}

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Direct Assignment** | Roles explicitly granted to users | User gets PROJECT_ADMIN on Notebook A |
| **Role Inheritance** | Higher roles include lower role permissions | PROJECT_ADMIN inherits PROJECT_MANAGER |
| **Virtual Roles** | Automatic roles from team membership | TEAM_MEMBER gets PROJECT_CONTRIBUTOR on team notebooks |
| **Permission Override** | More specific roles override general ones | PROJECT_ADMIN overrides TEAM_MEMBER |

### Terminology Alignment

| UI Term | Code Term | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Notebook** | Project | Data collection instance |
| **Template** | Template | Reusable notebook design |
| **Editor/Designer** | UI Specification | Notebook structure definition |
| **Records** | Project Records | Collected data entries |
| **Create Notebook** | CREATE_PROJECT | Action to make new notebook |
| **Edit Notebook** | UPDATE_PROJECT_UISPEC | Action to modify structure |

## 7. Troubleshooting Permissions {important}

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution | Check Location |
|---------|--------------|----------|----------------|
| "Can't create notebook" | Missing GENERAL_CREATOR | Grant GENERAL_CREATOR role | Users → [User] → Roles |
| "Can't edit notebook structure" | Missing PROJECT_MANAGER | Add as notebook manager | Notebook → Users |
| "Can't see team notebooks" | Not team member | Add to team | Team → Users → Add |
| "Can't delete notebook" | Need PROJECT_ADMIN | Upgrade notebook role | Notebook → Users |
| "Can't add team admin" | Need GENERAL_ADMIN | Only system admin can do this | Contact system admin |

### Permission Debugging Checklist

1. Check global roles: Dashboard → Users → [User]
2. Check team membership: Teams → [Team] → Users
3. Check notebook roles: Notebooks → [Notebook] → Users
4. Check virtual roles from teams
5. Verify email is confirmed (some features restricted)

---

## 8. API Token Permissions {comprehensive}

Long-lived tokens inherit the permissions of the user who created them:

| Token Creator Role | Token Permissions |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| GENERAL_USER | Basic read access only |
| GENERAL_CREATOR | Can create resources via API |
| GENERAL_ADMIN | Full API access |

### Token Management

- Users: Can create/revoke own tokens
- GENERAL_ADMIN: Can manage any user's tokens
- Dashboard: Users → [User] → API Tokens

---

## 9. Special Cases and Edge Conditions {comprehensive}

### Orphaned Notebooks
- Notebooks without team ownership
- Only PROJECT roles apply (no team virtual roles)
- GENERAL_ADMIN can reassign to team

### Permission Conflicts
Resolution order (highest priority first):
1. Direct notebook role (PROJECT_*)
2. Team virtual role (from TEAM_*)
3. Global permissions (GENERAL_*)

### Cross-Team Scenarios
- Users can belong to multiple teams
- Each team's virtual roles apply independently
- No permission inheritance between teams
