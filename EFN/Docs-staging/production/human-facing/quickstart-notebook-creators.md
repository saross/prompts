## Before You Start

**You'll need**: A Fieldmark account with at least Standard User permissions. If you don't have an account yet, ask your project administrator to invite you.

**Browser**: Works best with Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Make sure you're using a recent version.

### 📖 Quick Terms to Know

Before we dive in, here are four terms you'll see:

- **Dashboard**: Your home screen after logging in - think of it as mission control
- **Notebook**: A data collection form you create and customise
- **Editor** (formerly Designer): The tool where you build and modify notebooks
- **Records**: The actual data entries people create using your notebook
- **Fields**: Individual input elements (like text boxes or photo buttons) in your form

## Step 1: Access Your Dashboard (2 minutes)

Let's begin by logging into Fieldmark and finding our way around.

### Login to Fieldmark

1. Open your browser and go to your Fieldmark URL (usually something like `https://yourproject.fieldmark.app`)
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click **Sign In**

[SCREENSHOT: Login page with email and password fields]

### Welcome to Your Dashboard!

After logging in, you'll see the Home dashboard. This is your command centre where you can:
- Create new notebooks
- Access existing notebooks
- View recent activity
- Manage your projects

[SCREENSHOT: Home dashboard showing the main navigation and Create Notebook button]

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Bookmark this page! You'll be coming back here often. In most browsers, press `Ctrl+D` (Windows) or `Cmd+D` (Mac) to bookmark.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- You see your name or email in the top-right corner

## Step 2: Create Your First Notebook (3 minutes)

Creating a notebook is easier than making a sandwich. Let's do it!

### Start Fresh

1. From the Home dashboard, click the big **Create Notebook** button
   - It's usually in the top-right area
   - Can't miss it - it's designed to catch your eye!

2. You'll see the Create Notebook dialog:

[SCREENSHOT: Create Notebook dialog with name field and template dropdown]

3. Fill in these details:
   - **Name**: Type "My First Survey" (or any name you like!)
   - **Template**: Leave this empty - we're starting from scratch
   - **Team Owner**: If you see this field, leave it as-is

4. Click **Create**

### Hello, Editor!

Fantastic! You're now in the Editor (some people still call it the Designer). This is where the magic happens.

[SCREENSHOT: Empty Editor interface showing the three-panel layout]

You'll see three main areas:
- **Left panel**: Your notebook structure
- **Centre panel**: The form preview
- **Right panel**: Field configuration

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Don't worry if it looks empty - that's normal! We're about to fill it with useful fields. Remember, you can always come back and change things later.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- The Editor opens with an empty canvas
- You see the three-panel layout described above
- The notebook name appears at the top (likely shows "My First Survey")
- [VISUAL CHECK: Your instructor can verify you're in the right place]

> 📱 **Mobile Users**: The Editor works best on tablets or computers. If you're on a phone, you might want to switch devices for this setup phase. Once created, your notebook will work great on mobile for data collection!

---

## Step 3: Add Your Fields (5-7 minutes)

Now for the fun part - let's add fields to collect data! We'll add five simple fields, taking our time with each one.

### Part A: Your First Two Fields (2 minutes)

Let's start with the basics - a text field and a dropdown. These are the most common field types you'll use.

#### Field 1: Site Name (Text Field)

1. **Find the field**: In the right panel (or field palette), look for **TextField**
2. **Add it**: Click or drag TextField to add it to your form
3. **Configure it** in the configuration panel that appears:
   - **Label**: Type "Site Name"
   - **Field Name**: Will auto-generate as "site_name" (leave this as-is)
   - **Required**: Check this box ✓ (means users must fill it in)

[SCREENSHOT: Adding a TextField with configuration panel open]

> ✓ **Check Your Progress**: You should see "Site Name" appear in the centre panel preview. If not, make sure you clicked "Add" or dragged the field properly.

#### Field 2: Site Type (Dropdown)

Now let's add a dropdown for selecting options.

1. **Find it**: Look for **Select** in the field palette
2. **Add it**: Click or drag to add it below your Site Name field
3. **Configure it**:
   - **Label**: Type "Site Type"
   - **Options**: Click "Add Option" and add these one by one:
     - Archaeological
     - Geological  
     - Ecological
     - Other

> 💡 **Platform Note**: On touchscreens, dropdowns become easy-to-tap selection lists.

**Pause and Save**: Click **Save** (usually in the top-right corner) to save your progress. Good habit to save often!

### Part B: Date and Long Text (2 minutes)

Now let's add fields for capturing when and what happened.

#### Field 3: Visit Date (Date Picker)

Every record needs a date!

1. **Find it**: Look for **DateTimeNative** 
2. **Add it**: Place it below Site Type
3. **Configure it**:
   - **Label**: Type "Visit Date"
   - **Required**: Check this ✓ (dates are important!)

> ✓ **Check Your Progress**: You now have three fields showing in your preview. The date field might show today's date or a calendar icon.

#### Field 4: Observations (Text Area)

For longer descriptions, we need a bigger text box.

1. **Find it**: Add another **TextField** (yes, the same type as Field 1)
2. **Add it**: Place it below Visit Date
3. **Configure it differently**:
   - **Label**: Type "Observations"
   - **Multiline**: Check this box ✓ (this makes it a text area instead of single line)
   - **Rows**: Set to 4 (makes the box taller)

> 📱 **Mobile Tip**: Text areas automatically expand on mobile devices as users type more content.

### Part C: Adding Photo Capability (1 minute)

Let's add the ability to capture photos - perfect for field documentation!

#### Field 5: Site Photo (Camera)

1. **Find it**: Look for **TakePhoto** in the palette
2. **Add it**: Place it at the bottom of your form
3. **Configure it**:
   - **Label**: Type "Site Photo"
   - **Multiple**: Leave unchecked (one photo is enough for now)

[SCREENSHOT: Completed form showing all five fields in the Editor]

### ✓ Final Check: You'll Know It Worked When...

Before moving on, verify:
- You can see 5 fields in the centre panel preview
- They appear in this order: Site Name, Site Type, Visit Date, Observations, Site Photo
- Each field shows its label
- [VISUAL CHECK: Have someone verify your form looks complete]

### Save Your Complete Design!

**Critical**: Click the **Save** button to save your notebook design. Look for:
- A "Save" button (usually top-right)
- Or a save icon (💾 or similar)
- You might see a "Saved" confirmation message

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Start simple like we just did. You can always come back to add more fields, validation rules, or conditional logic once you understand your data collection needs better. Most successful notebooks start with 5-10 fields and grow from there.

---

## Step 4: Test Your Notebook (3 minutes)

Time to see your creation in action! Let's enter some test data.

### Switch to Data Entry Mode

Now we need to exit the Editor and use your notebook. Here are three ways to do this:

**Option A: Direct Navigation** (Most common)
- Look for a "View Notebook" or "Exit Editor" button (usually in the top toolbar)
- Click it to switch to data entry mode

**Option B: Using Breadcrumbs**
- Look at the top of the page for a breadcrumb trail (like: Home > My First Survey > Editor)
- Click on "My First Survey" (the notebook name) to exit Editor mode

**Option C: Via Dashboard** (Always works)
- Click "Home" or the Fieldmark logo to return to the dashboard
- Find "My First Survey" in your notebooks list
- Click to open it in data entry mode

[SCREENSHOT: Empty data entry form showing the five fields we created]

### ✓ You'll Know You're in Data Entry Mode When...
- The Editor panels are gone
- You see your form as users will see it
- There's an empty form with your 5 fields ready to fill in
- You can click in the fields to enter data

### Create Your First Record

Let's fill in some test data:

1. **Site Name**: Enter "Test Location 1"
2. **Site Type**: Select "Archaeological" from the dropdown
3. **Visit Date**: Pick today's date
4. **Observations**: Type "This is my first record! The site shows promising features."
5. **Site Photo**: 
   - Click the camera button
   - Allow camera permissions if asked
   - Take a photo (even of your coffee mug - this is just practice!)

[SCREENSHOT: Filled form with sample data]

### Save Your Record

Look for the **Save** button - it's typically:
- At the bottom of the form
- Or in the top-right corner
- Might say "Save", "Submit", or show a save icon (💾)

Click it. Congratulations! 🎉 You've just created your first record!

### ✓ You'll Know It Saved When...
- You see a success message (like "Record saved successfully")
- The form might clear or reset
- You might be redirected to the Records list
- [VISUAL CHECK: No error messages appear]

### View Your Success

1. Navigate to the **Records** tab (look at the top of the page, near where it says "My First Survey")
2. You should see your record listed there:
   - Shows "Test Location 1" (or whatever you entered)
   - Shows today's date
   - Might show a thumbnail of your photo
3. Click on the record to view the full details

[SCREENSHOT: Records list showing the saved record]

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Forgot to save? Don't worry - it happens to everyone. The system might warn you if you try to navigate away with unsaved changes. Always look for that Save button!

> 📱 **Mobile Note**: On mobile devices, the Records tab might be in a menu. Look for a hamburger menu (☰) if you don't see tabs.

## Step 5: Refine and Share (2 minutes)

Your notebook works! Now let's make a small improvement and share it with others.

### Make an Improvement

1. **Return to the Editor**:
   - Look for an "Edit" button (usually near the notebook name)
   - Or find "Editor" or "Designer" in the navigation
   - Click it to re-enter editing mode

2. **Find and select the "Site Name" field**:
   - Click directly on the Site Name field in the centre preview
   - The configuration panel should appear on the right

3. **Add helpful guidance**:
   - In the configuration panel, find **Helper Text** or **Description**
   - Type: "Enter the official site designation or location name"
   - This text will appear below the field to guide users

4. **Save your changes**:
   - Click the Save button (same location as before)
   - Wait for confirmation

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- The helper text appears under the Site Name field
- You see "Saved" or similar confirmation
- When you test the form again, the helper text is visible

You've just learned how to iterate and improve your notebook!

## Quick Troubleshooting

Running into issues? Here are the most common problems and solutions:

### "I can't find the Create Notebook button"
**Solution**: Make sure you're on the Home dashboard. If you're in a different section, look for "Home" in the navigation menu.

### "I can't take a photo"
**Solution**: Make sure you've granted camera permissions to your browser. On mobile devices, check your browser settings. On desktop, you might need a webcam.
