Creating a notebook is easy. Let's do it!

### Create a New Notebook

From the Dashboard:

1. Click **Notebooks** in the left navigation
2. Click **+ Create Notebook**

[SCREENSHOT: Notebooks interface showing Create Notebook button]

### Name Your Creation

In the creation dialog:
1. **Template/Notebook Name**: Type "My First Survey" (or any name you like!)
2. **Select team**: Use the dropdown to select the team the notebook belongs to (usually there will only be one option) 
3. Ignore the 'optional' fields
4. Click **Create Notebook**

### Navigating to your new, blank notebook

After you click 'Create Notebook', you will return to the list of notebooks, where you should:
1. Go to the end of the list, clicking through to later pages if needed
3. Click on the name of the notebook you just created (last in the list)
4. Click on the **Actions** tab
5. Click **Open in Editor**

### Hello, Notebook Editor!

Fantastic! You're now in the Notebook Editor. This is where the magic happens.

[SCREENSHOT: Notebook Editor interface showing the form builder layout]

You'll see the main interface elements:
- **Top bar (right side)**: CANCEL (gray) and SAVE (green) buttons

- **Right side**: UNDO and REDO buttons
- **Blue info box**: Instructions explaining forms and sections
- **"+" button (below info box)**: Click to add a new form
- **Form editing area**: Shows "Form Name" field with "Form 1" pre-filled
- **ADD NEW FORM button**: Green button to the right of the form name field

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Don't worry if it looks empty - that's normal! We're about to fill it with useful fields. Remember to click the green SAVE button in the top-right when you want to save your work.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- The Notebook Editor opens with "Form 1" in the Form Name field
- You see the blue info box with UI instruction text
- The "+" button is visible below the info box (for adding new forms)
- The Form Name field (showing "Form 1") is visible to the left of the green "ADD NEW FORM" button
- The DESIGN tab is selected and shows a green underline
- SAVE and CANCEL buttons are visible in the top-right
- No error messages appear

> 📱 **Mobile Users**: The Notebook Editor works best on tablets or computers. If you're on a phone, you might want to switch devices for this setup phase. Once created, your notebook will work perfectly on mobile for data collection!

### Understanding Notebooks Structure

Before we add fields, let's understand how Fieldmark organizes your data:

**Notebooks** contain **Forms** → **Forms** contain **Sections** → **Sections** contain **Form Fields** (where you enter data)

Think of it like this:
- 📓 **Notebook** = Your entire survey or data collection project ("My First Survey")
- 📋 **Form** = A specific data entry screen ("Site Details", "Environmental Observations", etc.)
- 📂 **Section** = A group of related fields within a form (optional, for organization)
- ✏️ **Form Field** = Individual data entry points (text boxes, dropdowns, etc.)

Right now, we have a notebook with one empty form called "Form 1". Let's make it more meaningful!

### Name Your Form

Let's give "Form 1" a descriptive name:

1. **Click in the Form Name field** (where it says "Form 1")
2. **Clear the text** and type **"Site Details"** (or another name that describes what data you'll collect)
3. **Press the green "ADD NEW FORM" button** to create the form

[SCREENSHOT: Form Name field being edited to "Site Details", ADD NEW FORM button highlighted]

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Use descriptive form names like "Daily Observations", "Specimen Collection", or "Interview Notes" - they'll make it easier to navigate your data later.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- The form name has changed from "Form 1" to your chosen name ("Site Details")
- You see the form badge showing "FORM: SITE DETAILS" in the editing area
- A green success message appears: "Form has been created. Add a section to get started."
- Form controls are visible: DELETE FORM and EDIT FORM NAME options
- Form Settings panel is visible below

[SCREENSHOT: Created form showing "Site Details" with success message and Section Name field]

Now you're ready to add a section to organize your fields!

### Create Your First Section

Sections help organize related fields within a form. Let's create one:

1. **Scroll down** to find the "Section Name" field (it should be visible below the success message)
2. **Click in the Section Name field** and type **"Basic Information"** (or another name that groups your first set of fields)
3. **Click the "+" button** next to the Section Name field to create the section

[SCREENSHOT: Section Name field being edited to "Basic Information", "+" button highlighted]

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Use section names like "Location Details", "Measurements", or "Photos" to group related fields - this makes forms easier to navigate, especially on mobile devices.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- The interface changes to show your section: "Basic Information" with a green badge showing "1" (representing "first section")
- Section controls appear: DELETE SECTION, DUPLICATE SECTION, MOVE SECTION, EDIT SECTION NAME, ADD NEW SECTION
- You see the **"ADD A FIELD"** button (with green plus icon)
- "Visible Fields" and "Hidden Fields" areas are shown below
- The section is ready to receive form fields

[SCREENSHOT: Created section showing "Basic Information" with editing controls and "ADD A FIELD" button visible]

Perfect! Now your form has a section, and we're in the main editing interface where we'll add fields!

---

## Step 3: Add Your Fields (5-7 minutes)

Now for the fun part - let's add fields to collect data! We'll add five essential fields, taking our time with each one.

### Part A: Your First Two Fields (2 minutes)

Let's start with the basics - a text field and a dropdown. These are the bread and butter of data collection.

#### Field 1: Site Name (Text Field)

1. **Click the "ADD A FIELD" button** (green button with plus icon)
2. **In the "Add a field" dialog that opens**:
   - **Field name**: Change "New Field" to **"Site Name"**
   - **Field type**: Click on **"FAIMS Text Field"** (single-line text input)
   - Click **"ADD FIELD"** button at bottom

[SCREENSHOT: "Add a field" dialog showing field name changed to "Site Name" and "FAIMS Text Field" selected]

3. **The field appears collapsed** - click anywhere on the grey bar to expand it
4. **Configure the field**:
   - **Label**: Already shows "Site Name" ✓
   - **Field ID**: Auto-generated as "Site-Name" ✓
   - **Helper Text**: Type "Enter the official site designation or name"
   - **Required**: Toggle ON ☑

[SCREENSHOT: Expanded "Site Name" field showing configuration options with Required toggled on]

> ✓ **Check Your Progress**: The "Site Name" field is now in the "Visible Fields" area, configured as required, with helper text set.

> 💡 **More Options**: Fields can also have Advanced Helper Text (formatted popup help), Conditions (show/hide based on other fields), Annotations, or "Copy value to new records" for smart defaults. We'll keep it simple for now!

#### Field 2: Site Type (Dropdown)

Now let's add a dropdown for selecting options.

1. **Find it**: Look for **Select** in the left panel
2. **Add it**: Click on **Select** to add it to your form (it will appear below your Site Name field)
3. **Configure it**:
   - **Field Label**: Type "Site Type"
   - **Options**: Click "Add Option" and add these one by one:
     - Archaeological
     - Geological  
     - Ecological
     - Other
   - **Required**: Toggle on ✓

> 💡 **Platform Note**: On mobile devices, Select fields automatically adapt to native pickers for better usability.

**Quick Save**: Click the **Save** button in the top navigation to save your progress.

### Part B: Date and Long Text (2 minutes)

Now let's add fields for capturing when and what happened.

#### Field 3: Visit Date (Date Picker)

Every record needs a date!

1. **Find it**: Look for **DateTime with Now button** (captures current date/time automatically)
2. **Add it**: Click on the field type to add it to your form
3. **Configure it**:
   - **Field Label**: Type "Visit Date"
   - **Required**: Toggle on ✓
   - **Hide Time**: Toggle on if you only need the date

> ✓ **Check Your Progress**: You now have three fields in your form. The date field shows it will auto-populate with "now".

#### Field 4: Observations (Text Area)

For longer descriptions, we need a multiline text field.

1. **Find it**: Look for **MultipleTextField** (designed for longer text)
2. **Add it**: Click on the field type to add it to your form
3. **Configure it**:
   - **Field Label**: Type "Observations"
   - **Number of Rows**: Set to 4
   - **Helper Text**: "Describe site conditions and notable features"

> 📱 **Mobile Tip**: MultipleTextField automatically expands on mobile devices as users type more content.

### Part C: Adding Photo Capability (1 minute)

Let's add the ability to capture photos - essential for field documentation!

#### Field 5: Site Photo (Camera)

1. **Find it**: Look for **TakePhoto** in the field palette
2. **Add it**: Click on the field type to add it to your form
3. **Configure it**:
   - **Field Label**: Type "Site Photo"
   - **Required**: Leave off (photos optional)
   - **Multiple Photos**: Leave off for now

[SCREENSHOT: Completed form showing all five fields in the Notebook Editor]

### Adding Form Completion Settings

One crucial step - let's ensure records can be properly saved:

1. Click on **Form Settings** (gear icon or settings button)
2. Find **Form Completion**:
   - **Submit Button Label**: Set to "Save Record"
   - **Show Summary**: Toggle on
3. Find **Record Identification**:
   - Enable **Auto-generate HRID** (Human Readable ID)
   - Pattern: Leave as default or set to "SITE-{{YYYY}}-{{autoincrement}}"

### ✓ Final Check: You'll Know It Worked When...

Before moving on, verify:
- You can see 5 fields in the centre panel
- They appear in order: Site Name, Site Type, Visit Date, Observations, Site Photo
- Required fields show red asterisks (*)
- Form settings show "Save Record" button configured

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Start simple like we just did. You can always come back to add more fields, validation rules, or conditional logic. Most successful notebooks begin with 5-10 fields and evolve based on actual use.

---

## Step 4: Deploy and Test Your Notebook (3 minutes)

Time to see your creation in action! Let's deploy your template as a notebook and enter test data.

### Deploy Your Template

1. **Save the Template**: Click **Save** one more time to ensure everything is saved
2. **Create Notebook from Template**:
   - Look for **Deploy** or **Create Notebook** button
   - Or go to the **Actions** menu and select "Create Notebook"
3. **Name Your Notebook**: 
   - Keep "My First Survey" or rename it
   - Click **Create**

### Access Your Notebook

After deployment, you'll either:

[SCREENSHOT: Records list showing the saved record]

> ⚠️ **Can't See Records?** Make sure you're in the notebook view, not the template. Templates are for design; notebooks are for data collection.

---

## Step 5: Collaborate and Refine (2 minutes)

Your notebook works! Now let's share it with others and learn about permissions.

### Understanding Permissions

Fieldmark uses a role-based permission system. As the notebook creator, you're automatically the **Notebook Administrator**. Here's what each role can do:

| Role | Can Do |
|------|--------|
| **Data Collector** | Add and edit their own records |
| **Data Reviewer** | Review and approve records |
| **Data Viewer** | View records only (read-only) |
| **Notebook Admin** | Everything, including inviting users |

### Invite a Team Member

1. In your notebook, find the **Users** or **Invites** tab
2. Click **Invite User**
3. Enter their details:
   - **Email**: Their email address
   - **Role**: Choose "Data Collector" to start
   - **Message**: Optional welcome message
4. Click **Send Invitation**

[SCREENSHOT: Invite users dialog]

They'll receive an email invitation to join your notebook!

> 💡 **Team Tip**: If you're part of a team, team members automatically get access through virtual roles - no individual invitations needed!

### Make an Improvement

Let's add one enhancement based on what we learned:

1. Return to **Templates** section
2. Find your "My First Survey" template
3. Click **Edit** to reopen the Notebook Editor
4. Select the "Observations" field
5. Add **Validation**:
   - Minimum length: 10 characters
   - Validation message: "Please provide at least 10 characters"
6. **Save** the template

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Changes to templates don't affect existing notebooks. You'll need to create a new notebook from the updated template or manually update the existing one.

## Quick Troubleshooting

Running into issues? Here are solutions to common problems:

### "I can't find the Notebook Editor"
**Solution**: Check that you're a member of a team with appropriate permissions. Team members can access the Notebook Editor based on their team role.

### "My Save button isn't appearing"
**Solution**: Check Form Settings → Form Completion → Publish Button Behaviour. Make sure it's configured properly.

### "The person I invited hasn't received an email"
**Solution**: 
1. Check their spam/junk folder
2. Verify the email address is correct
3. Check the Invites tab for status
4. Resend if needed

### "I can't take a photo"
**Solution**: 
- **Mobile**: Check app permissions in device settings
- **Desktop**: Ensure browser has camera access
- **All platforms**: HTTPS connection required for camera access

### "My record ID looks weird (like rec_xxxxx)"
**Solution**: You need to configure an HRID field. Go to Form Settings and set up the human-readable ID pattern.

### "Changes to my template aren't showing in the notebook"
**Solution**: Templates and notebooks are separate. Create a new notebook from the updated template, or manually update the existing notebook's configuration.
