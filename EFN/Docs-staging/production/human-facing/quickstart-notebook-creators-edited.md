Creating a notebook is easy. Let's do it!

### Create a New Notebook

From the Dashboard:

1. Click **Notebooks** in the left navigation
2. Click **+ Create Notebook**

[SCREENSHOT: Notebooks interface showing Create Notebook button]

### Name Your Creation

In the creation dialog:
1. **Template/Notebook Name**: Type "My First Survey" (or any name you like!)
2. **Select team**: Use the dropdown to select the team the notebook belongs to (usually there will only be one option) 
3. Ignore the 'optional' fields
4. Click **Create Notebook**

### Navigating to your new, blank notebook

After you click 'Create Notebook', you will return to the list of notebooks, where you should:
1. Go to the end of the list, clicking through to later pages if needed
3. Click on the name of the notebook you just created (last in the list)
4. Click on the **Actions** tab
5. Click **Open in Editor**

### Hello, Notebook Editor!

Fantastic! You're now in the Notebook Editor. This is where the magic happens.

[SCREENSHOT: Notebook Editor interface showing the form builder layout]

You'll see the main interface elements:
- **Top bar (right side)**: CANCEL (gray) and SAVE (green) buttons

- **Right side**: UNDO and REDO buttons
- **Blue info box**: Instructions explaining forms and sections
- **"+" button (below info box)**: Click to add a new form
- **Form editing area**: Shows "Form Name" field with "Form 1" pre-filled
- **ADD NEW FORM button**: Green button to the right of the form name field

> ⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Don't worry if it looks empty - that's normal! We're about to fill it with useful fields. Remember to click the green SAVE button in the top-right when you want to save your work.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- The Notebook Editor opens with "Form 1" in the Form Name field
- You see the blue info box with UI instruction text
- The "+" button is visible below the info box (for adding new forms)
- The Form Name field (showing "Form 1") is visible to the left of the green "ADD NEW FORM" button
- The DESIGN tab is selected and shows a green underline
- SAVE and CANCEL buttons are visible in the top-right
- No error messages appear

> 📱 **Mobile Users**: The Notebook Editor works best on tablets or computers. If you're on a phone, you might want to switch devices for this setup phase. Once created, your notebook will work perfectly on mobile for data collection!

### Understanding Notebooks Structure

Before we add fields, let's understand how Fieldmark organizes your data:

**Notebooks** contain **Forms** → **Forms** contain **Sections** → **Sections** contain **Form Fields** (where you enter data)

Think of it like this:
- 📓 **Notebook** = Your entire survey or data collection project ("My First Survey")
- 📋 **Form** = A specific data entry screen ("Site Details", "Environmental Observations", etc.)
- 📂 **Section** = A group of related fields within a form (optional, for organization)
- ✏️ **Form Field** = Individual data entry points (text boxes, dropdowns, etc.)

Right now, we have a notebook with one empty form called "Form 1". Let's make it more meaningful!

### Name Your Form

Let's give "Form 1" a descriptive name:

1. **Click in the Form Name field** (where it says "Form 1")
2. **Clear the text** and type **"Site Details"** (or another name that describes what data you'll collect)
3. **Press the green "ADD NEW FORM" button** to create the form

[SCREENSHOT: Form Name field being edited to "Site Details", ADD NEW FORM button highlighted]

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Use descriptive form names like "Daily Observations", "Specimen Collection", or "Interview Notes" - they'll make it easier to navigate your data later.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- The form name has changed from "Form 1" to your chosen name ("Site Details")
- You see the form badge showing "FORM: SITE DETAILS" in the editing area
- A green success message appears: "Form has been created. Add a section to get started."
- Form controls are visible: DELETE FORM and EDIT FORM NAME options
- Form Settings panel is visible below

[SCREENSHOT: Created form showing "Site Details" with success message and Section Name field]

Now you're ready to add a section to organize your fields!

### Create Your First Section

Sections help organize related fields within a form. Let's create one:

1. **Scroll down** to find the "Section Name" field (it should be visible below the success message)
2. **Click in the Section Name field** and type **"Basic Information"** (or another name that groups your first set of fields)
3. **Click the "+" button** next to the Section Name field to create the section

[SCREENSHOT: Section Name field being edited to "Basic Information", "+" button highlighted]

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Use section names like "Location Details", "Measurements", or "Photos" to group related fields - this makes forms easier to navigate, especially on mobile devices.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- The interface changes to show your section: "Basic Information" with a green badge showing "1" (representing "first section")
- Section controls appear: DELETE SECTION, DUPLICATE SECTION, MOVE SECTION, EDIT SECTION NAME, ADD NEW SECTION
- You see the **"ADD A FIELD"** button (with green plus icon)
- "Visible Fields" and "Hidden Fields" areas are shown below
- The section is ready to receive form fields

[SCREENSHOT: Created section showing "Basic Information" with editing controls and "ADD A FIELD" button visible]

Perfect! Now your form has a section, and we're in the main editing interface where we'll add fields!

---

## Step 3: Add Your Fields (5-7 minutes)

Now for the fun part - let's add fields to collect data! We'll add five essential fields, taking our time with each one.

### Part A: Your First Two Fields (2 minutes)

Let's start with the basics - a text field and a dropdown. These are the bread and butter of data collection.

#### Field 1: Site Name (Text Field)

1. **Click the "ADD A FIELD" button** (green button with plus icon)
2. **In the "Add a field" dialog that opens**:
   - **Field name**: Change "New Field" to **"Site Name"**
   - **Field type**: Click on **"FAIMS Text Field"** (single-line text input)
   - Click **"ADD FIELD"** button at bottom

[SCREENSHOT: "Add a field" dialog showing field name changed to "Site Name" and "FAIMS Text Field" selected]

#### Field 2: Site Type (Radio Buttons)

Now let's add a choice field where users select one option from a list.

1. **Collapse the Site Name field** - click on the grey bar to collapse it
2. **Click the "ADD A FIELD" button**
3. **In the "Add a field" dialog**:
   - **Field name**: Change "New Field" to **"Site Type"**
   - **Navigate to Choice fields**: Click the right chevron (>) next to the category tabs to see more options
   - **Field type**: Click on **"Select one option"** (creates radio buttons)
   - Click **"ADD FIELD"**

[SCREENSHOT: "Add a field" dialog showing CHOICE category with "Select one option" highlighted]

4. **If the field appears collapsed** - click on the grey bar to expand it
5. **Add your options** - these are the choices users will see:

   - Click the **pencil icon** (edit) next to "1" to open the "Edit Option" dialog
   - Change "1" to **"Habitation"** and click **SAVE**
   - Now use **"Add Option"** field to add the remaining options:
     - Type **"Mortuary"** and click **"Add"**
     - Repeat for: **"Ceremonial"**, **"Workshop/Industrial"**, **"Defensive"**, **"Agricultural"**, **"Other"**
   - Use the drag handles (⋮⋮) or up/down arrows to reorder if needed

> - **Uncertainty**: Flag observations you're unsure about for later review

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: You can use markdown in option text - try `**Important Option**` to make text bold!

**Quick Save**: Click the **SAVE** button in the top-right to save your progress.

### Part B: Date and Long Text (2 minutes)

Now let's add fields for capturing when and what happened.

#### Field 3: Survey Date (Date and Time)

While Fieldmark automatically timestamps all records, explicitly capturing dates as field data is important: it affirms from human input when information was collected and makes data easier to work with when exported.

1. **Collapse the Site Type field** - click on the grey bar to collapse it
2. **Click the "ADD A FIELD" button**
3. **In the "Add a field" dialog**:
   - **Field name**: Change "New Field" to **"Survey Date"**

### Save Your Work

**Important:** The Notebook Editor does not auto-save. Let's save your progress now.

1. **Click the green SAVE button** in the top-right corner
2. **You'll be returned to the Dashboard** - this is expected behavior
3. **To continue editing later**, simply click **"Open in Editor"** again from the Dashboard

> ⚠️ **Remember to Save**: Get in the habit of clicking SAVE periodically as you work. The Editor will close and return you to the Dashboard each time you save, but you can immediately click "Open in Editor" to resume editing.

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Start simple like we just did. You can always come back to add more fields, validation rules, or conditional logic. Most successful notebooks begin with 5-10 fields and evolve based on actual use. Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore the **INFO tab** to add project metadata like project lead, organization, and custom key-value pairs.

   - Or click **NOW** button to update to the current time
   - Click "Clear" or "Today" in the picker as needed

6. **Fill in Observations**:
   - Type in the multi-line text area: "I looked at the site and it's a dwelling"
   - This field is optional (no red asterisk)
   - Helper text shows: "Describe site conditions, features, and any notable characteristics"

7. **Add a Site Photo**:
   - Scroll to the Site Photo section
   - You'll see "No Photos Yet" with a **"TAKE FIRST PHOTO"** button
   - Click the green photo button

[SCREENSHOT: SETTINGS tab showing "Sync Notebook" toggle ON, "Get attachments from other devices" toggle Off, and "Deactivate Notebook" section]

You'll see several important controls:

**Sync Notebook**
- Toggle switch (currently ON)
- Controls whether this notebook syncs to the server
- Turn this OFF to save mobile data when working in the field
- Your data is still saved locally; it will sync when you turn it back ON

**Get attachments from other devices**
- Toggle switch (currently Off)
- When enabled, Fieldmark automatically downloads photos and attachments created by other team members
- **Trade-off**: Lets you see what your team is documenting, but uses more storage and mobile data
- **Important**: Your uploads always go to the server regardless of this setting
- Recommended: Keep OFF to minimize data usage, turn ON when on WiFi if you want to review team photos

**Deactivate Notebook**
- Removes the notebook from your active list
- **Warning**: Make sure all your data has synced before deactivating (check for green cloud icons!)
- Click **DEACTIVATE NOTEBOOK** button (red text) only if you're done using this notebook on this device

> 💡 **Data Management Tip**: If you're working in areas with limited connectivity or want to conserve mobile data, turn OFF "Sync Notebook" while collecting data. Turn it back ON when you have WiFi to upload your records to the server.
