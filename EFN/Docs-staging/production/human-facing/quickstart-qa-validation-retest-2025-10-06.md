## Metric-by-Metric Analysis

### Technical Accuracy Metrics

#### ✅ 1. Field component names match reference.md? **PASS**

**Evidence** (Lines 212, 243, 294):
- "FAIMS Text Field" (single-line text input)
- "Select one option" (creates radio buttons)
- "Take Photo" (enables camera capture)

**Analysis**: Field component names accurately match the Notebook Editor UI names from reference documentation. Parenthetical clarifications help users identify the correct field types.

**Verdict**: **PASS** ✅

---

#### ✅ 2. Dashboard → Editor navigation workflows correct? **PASS**

**Evidence** (Lines 78-110):

```markdown
1. Click **Notebooks** in the left navigation
2. Click **+ Create Notebook**
3. Name it "My First Survey"
4. Find notebook at END of list (lines 100-103)
5. Click notebook name
6. Click Actions tab
7. Click Open in Editor
```

**Critical Fix**: The workflow now correctly directs users to **Notebooks → Create Notebook** (NOT Templates → Create Template as in the baseline regenerated version).

**Analysis**: This is the **correct notebook-first workflow** for beginners. The template-first workflow error from baseline has been completely eliminated.

**Baseline Issue**: Regenerated version directed to Templates section (workflow-breaking error)
**Current Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Verdict**: **PASS** ✅

---

#### ✅ 3. UI element descriptions match screenshot evidence? **PASS**

**Evidence** (Lines 117-122):

```markdown
You'll see the main interface elements:
- **Top bar**: CANCEL and SAVE buttons on the right
- **Action buttons**: UNDO and REDO buttons (below the top bar, above the tabs)
- **Tab bar**: DESIGN and INFO tabs on the left
- **"+" button**: Click to add a new form
- **Form editing area**: Shows "Form Name" field with "Form 1" pre-filled
```

**Analysis**: Provides **precise UI element locations** with hierarchical positioning (top bar → action buttons → tab bar). Screenshot placeholders use production-ready paths with detailed alt-text descriptions.

**Screenshot Format** (Line 49):
```markdown
![Fieldmark login page with Email Address and Password fields...](../screenshots/quickstart/final/quickstart-001-login.png)
```

**Verdict**: **PASS** ✅

---

#### ✅ 4. Modal overlay architecture (not separate page misconception)? **PASS**

**Evidence** (Lines 210-211):

```markdown
1. **Click the "ADD A FIELD" button** (green button with plus icon)
2. **In the "Add a field" dialog that opens**:
```

**Analysis**: Explicitly describes "dialog that opens" to clarify modal overlay architecture. Users understand field addition happens in a modal dialogue, not a separate page.

**Baseline Issue**: Regenerated version omitted modal architecture context
**Current Status**: ✅ CLEAR

**Verdict**: **PASS** ✅

---

#### ✅ 5. Save behaviour (manual vs. auto-save)? **PASS**

**Evidence** (Lines 367-373):

```markdown
**Important:** The Notebook Editor does not auto-save. Let's save your progress now.

1. **Click the green SAVE button** in the top-right corner
2. **You'll be returned to the Dashboard** - this is expected behaviour
3. **To continue editing later**, simply click **"Open in Editor"** again

> ⚠️ **Remember to Save**: Get in the habit of clicking SAVE periodically as you work.
> The Editor will close and return you to the Dashboard each time you save...
```

**Critical Fix**: Explicitly warns about:
- No auto-save functionality
- Dashboard return after save (expected behaviour, not a bug)
- How to resume editing

**Analysis**: Addresses the **common user confusion** where users think the Editor crashed when returned to Dashboard. Clear messaging prevents support tickets.

**Baseline Issue**: Missing Dashboard return warning
**Current Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Verdict**: **PASS** ✅

---

#### ✅ 6. New item placement (end of list vs. beginning)? **PASS**

**Evidence** (Lines 100-105):

```markdown
1. **Find your new notebook**:
   - It will appear at the end of the notebook list
   - **If you have many notebooks**: Look for pagination controls at the bottom of the list (showing "1-10 of X notebooks" with arrow buttons)
   - **Quick tip**: Use the search bar at the top of the list to search for "My First Survey"
   - Scroll down and click through pages until you see your notebook
```

**Critical Fix**: Explicitly states:
- Notebooks appear at **END of list**
- Pagination controls location and format
- Search bar functionality
- How to navigate multi-page lists

**Analysis**: This guidance is **essential for users with 50+ notebooks** who would otherwise assume creation failed when new notebook doesn't appear at top of first page.

**Baseline Issue**: Missing pagination and search guidance (major usability regression)
**Current Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Verdict**: **PASS** ✅

---

#### ✅ 7. Field selection workflow (6-tab modal dialogue)? **PASS**

**Evidence** (Lines 242-244):

```markdown
3. **In the "Add a field" dialog**:
   - **Field name**: Change "New Field" to **"Site Type"**
   - **Navigate to Choice fields**: Click the right chevron (>) next to the category tabs to see more options
   - **Field type**: Click on **"Select one option"** (creates radio buttons)
```

**Analysis**: Describes tab navigation with **chevron controls** to access additional category tabs beyond the initially visible ones. Helps users understand how to explore all field type options.

**Verdict**: **PASS** ✅

---

#### ✅ 8. Collapsible panel interactions described? **PASS**

**Evidence** (Lines 217, 238, 289, 299):

```markdown
3. **Click on the grey bar** to expand the field
1. **Collapse the Site Name field** - click on the grey bar to collapse it
2. **Collapse the Site Type field** - click on the grey bar to collapse it
4. **Click on the grey bar** to expand the field
```

**Analysis**: Consistently describes expand/collapse interactions using "grey bar" terminology. Reinforces the interaction pattern through repetition across all three field examples.

**Verdict**: **PASS** ✅

---

### Technical Accuracy Summary

**Passed**: 8/8 metrics (100%)
**Failed**: 0/8 metrics

**Improvement from Baseline**: +50% (from 50% to 100%)

**Critical Errors Resolved**:
- Template-first workflow → Notebook-first workflow
