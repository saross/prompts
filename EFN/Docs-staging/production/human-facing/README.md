- Contractions are fine (you'll, won't, etc.)

### Structure
- Progressive disclosure (simple ‚Üí complex)
- Celebration of milestones
- Visual placeholders [SCREENSHOT: description]
- Clear success criteria
- Quick troubleshooting sections

### Tone
- Encouraging and supportive
- Never condescending
- Acknowledge that mistakes happen
- Build confidence through success

### Features

## Relationship to Technical Documentation

These documents complement but don't replace the technical documentation:

- **Technical docs** (`/production/*.md`): LLM-optimized, comprehensive, accurate
- **Human docs** (`/production/human-facing/*.md`): User-optimized, selective, encouraging

## Screenshot Strategy

Each document includes [SCREENSHOT] placeholders. When adding actual screenshots:

1. Capture at consistent resolution
2. Highlight relevant UI elements
3. Include alt text for accessibility
4. Keep file sizes reasonable (<200KB)
5. Use descriptive filenames

## Success Metrics

- Time to first success: <15 minutes
- User confidence: High
- Support tickets: Reduced
- Task completion: >90%

## Contributing

When adding new human-facing documentation:

1. Follow the established patterns
2. Test with real users if possible
3. Include all standard sections
4. Maintain encouraging tone
5. Add to this README
