- Configuration details

- Dropdown/Select field (radio buttons)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW CONSTRAINTS ‚ö†Ô∏è

**These constraints are based on QA testing that revealed critical documentation gaps. Violating these will create workflow-breaking errors for users.**

#### 1. Notebook-First Workflow for Beginners (NOT Template-First)
- **For quickstart/beginner documentation**: NEVER direct users to Templates ‚Üí Create Template
- **ALWAYS** use: Notebooks ‚Üí Create Notebook for first-time users
- Templates are an **advanced feature** for experienced users who need reusable patterns
- **Pedagogical rationale**: Novices need to field-test notebooks before converting to templates
- **Advanced users**: May use template-first workflow when appropriate for their needs
- Document template conversion as optional "next step" after field-testing
- Cross-reference: template-workflow-principle.md

#### 2. Activation Architecture
- Activation occurs in the **mobile/data collection app** (app.fieldmark.app)
- **NOT** in the Dashboard or Editor
- **NO** "Active" toggle exists in Editor's Info tab
- Process: Navigate to app.fieldmark.app ‚Üí NOT ACTIVE tab ‚Üí ACTIVATE button ‚Üí modal confirmation
- Cross-reference: activation-workflow.md

#### 3. List Behaviour (New Items at End)
- New notebooks appear at **END of list**, not beginning
- **MUST** document pagination controls ("1-10 of X notebooks")
- **MUST** document search bar for finding notebooks
- Users with many notebooks need explicit navigation guidance
- Cross-reference: ui-interaction-patterns.md Section 13

#### 4. Save Behaviour (No Auto-Save)
- Editor **does NOT auto-save**
- Clicking SAVE **closes Editor and returns to Dashboard**
- This is **expected behaviour**, not a bug
- Must document: "You'll be returned to the Dashboard - this is expected"
- Must explain: Click "Open in Editor" again to resume editing
- Cross-reference: ui-interaction-patterns.md Section 15

#### 5. Form ‚Üí Section ‚Üí Field Hierarchy
- Creation sequence: **Form FIRST, then Section, then Fields**
- **CANNOT** add fields without creating a section first
- Must explicitly show section creation step
- "Don't skip the section creation step" warning required
- Cross-reference: editor-form-settings.md

### Required Elements Throughout

#### Visual Markers
- [SCREENSHOT: description] placeholders (10-12 total)
- ‚úì checkpoints after major steps
- > blockquotes for tips and warnings
- Emoji usage: sparingly, only ‚úÖ, üöÄ, üéØ, üì±, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚ú®, üí°, üéä

#### Troubleshooting Boxes
After each major step, include common issues:
- Problem statement
- **Solution**: Clear fix
- Format as heading + solution

#### Platform Notes
- Mobile vs desktop differences
- Browser-specific behaviors
- Touchscreen adaptations

### Required Subsections at End

#### Success Checklist
- 8-10 items with checkboxes ([ ] format for markdown)
- Comprehensive coverage of all steps
- Victory message when complete
- **MUST include**: "Configured the Human-Readable ID Field (critical step!)"

#### Troubleshooting {optional-reference}
**MUST be clearly marked as optional reference material**

7 most common problems with solutions:
- Can't Find the Notebook Editor
- Notebook Not in List After Creation (END of list issue)
- Fields Not Showing in the Form
- Editor Closed After Clicking Save (expected behaviour)
- Records Show "rec_xxxxx" Instead of Readable Names (HRID issue - very common!)
- Notebook Not Appearing in Mobile App
- Photos Won't Upload

#### What's Next
- Immediate next steps (5-6 items)
- Brief mention of template conversion (as advanced feature)
- Help resources

#### Closing
- Encouraging final message
- Note about Fieldmark formerly being FAIMS3

### Technical Accuracy Requirements

Pull current information from reference.md for:

1. **Field Component Names**
   - Use Notebook Editor UI names (not JSON names)
   - Example: "DateTime with Now button" not "DateTimeNow"
   - Refer to designer-component-mapping.md

2. **Navigation Paths**
   - Dashboard ‚Üí Templates ‚Üí Create Template
   - User menu location (bottom-left)
   - Tab structures per interface documentation

3. **Permission Model**
   - Team-based access for templates
   - Virtual roles explanation
   - No individual "template permissions"

4. **Critical Configuration**
   - HRID field setup (prevents rec_xxxxx IDs)
   - Form completion settings
   - Required field indicators

### Style Guidelines

1. **Paragraph Length**: 2-3 sentences max
2. **List Items**: Brief, action-oriented
3. **Technical Terms**: Define on first use
4. **Voice**: Second person, present tense
5. **Encouragement**: After each major milestone

### Screenshot Placeholder Format
```
[SCREENSHOT: Brief description of what should be shown]
```

### Common Mistakes to Address (with Preventative Solutions)
- **Template-first workflow** ‚Üí Direct to Notebooks, mark Templates as advanced
- **HRID configuration missing** ‚Üí Dramatic warning box with before/after examples
- **Activation confusion** ‚Üí Explicit mobile app URL, clear NOT ACTIVE tab instructions
- **List navigation** ‚Üí Document pagination and search bar upfront
- **Save behaviour** ‚Üí "Expected behaviour" messaging
- **Section creation skipped** ‚Üí Explicit section creation step with warning

### Version Notes
- Mention Fieldmark (not FAIMS3) throughout
- Note the name change at the very end only
- Account for team-based permissions
- Include virtual roles concept
