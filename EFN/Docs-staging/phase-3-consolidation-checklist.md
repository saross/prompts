# Phase 3 Consolidation Checklist - LLM-First Documentation

## Status Update (2025-01-06)
**Trial Run COMPLETED**: Successfully consolidated field-selection-guide.md as proof of concept
- ✅ 3 documents consolidated into 1 guide (408 lines)
- ✅ All 8 field documents updated with cross-references
- ✅ Field-specific anchors working (#text-fields, #number-fields, etc.)
- ✅ No content lost, all information preserved
- ✅ Archives created with deprecation notices

**Next Steps**: Apply same pattern to remaining consolidations (7 guides remaining)

## Overview
Consolidate 22 existing documents (8 cross-field + 14 reference) into 8 comprehensive guides that serve as the single source of truth for LLM consumption. Archives are for disaster recovery only.

## Pre-Consolidation Setup
- [x] ✅ Create `/patterns/` directory for consolidated cross-field guides (COMPLETED 2025-01-06)
- [ ] Create `/references/` directory for consolidated technical references  
- [x] ✅ Create `/archive/` directory with subdirectories for original files (COMPLETED 2025-01-06)
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` to exclude archive from future searches (optional)

### C3: Update Build Script

  - field-type-index.md
  - 8 field category docs
  - 4 pattern guides
  - 4 reference guides
- [ ] Test concatenated reference.md generation
- [ ] Verify reference.md remains ~30K lines

### C4: Quality Assurance

- [ ] Test navigation from field docs to consolidated guides

## Proposed Starting Chunk (Trial Run)

### Chunk 1: Create field-selection-guide.md ✅ COMPLETED (Actual: 45 min)

This is the most self-contained consolidation and good test case:

1. **Setup** (10 min)
   - [x] ✅ Create `/patterns/` directory
   - [x] ✅ Create `/archive/cross-field/` directory

2. **Content Extraction** (30 min)
   - [x] ✅ Read field-selection-best-practices.md
   - [x] ✅ Read summary-table.md  
   - [x] ✅ Read quick-start.md
   - [x] ✅ Create field-selection-guide.md with:
     - Concatenation boundaries and metadata
     - All content from field-selection-best-practices
     - Comparison matrix from summary-table
     - Only field selection examples from quick-start

3. **Field Anchors** (10 min)
   - [x] ✅ Add field-specific sections with anchors
   - [x] ✅ Ensure each field type has dedicated section

4. **Cross-References** (10 min)
   - [x] ✅ Update ALL 8 field docs to reference new guide (exceeded plan)
   - [x] ✅ Test anchor navigation

5. **Archive** (5 min)
   - [x] ✅ Move field-selection-best-practices.md to archive
   - [x] ✅ Move summary-table.md to archive
   - [x] ✅ Add deprecation notices

This chunk will validate our approach before proceeding with the remaining consolidations.

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 22 source documents fully extracted (no content lost)
- [ ] 8 consolidated guides created with proper structure
- [ ] All field-specific anchors functional
- [ ] Archives contain originals but are never referenced
- [ ] reference.md builds correctly with new structure
- [ ] Navigation works bidirectionally between field docs and guides

## Notes
- Archive is ONLY for disaster recovery, not operational reference
- Every piece of content must be extracted, not referenced
- Field-specific anchors enable targeted navigation
- Getting-started content distributed across appropriate guides
- LLM generates contextual getting-started guides on demand
