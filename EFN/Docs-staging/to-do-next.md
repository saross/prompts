# To-Do Next: Fieldmark Documentation Session Handover

**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-01
**Last Session Summary**: Continued quickstart manual pilot - fixed Editor description and removed all drag-and-drop references

## Session Context

### What Was Accomplished
1. **Identified Critical Documentation Errors**:
   - "Start from scratch" option doesn't exist in notebook creation
   - Description field doesn't exist in creation dialog
   - Team selection is required (not automatic)
   - Editor is not drag-and-drop (uses buttons and forms)
   - Creating empty notebook returns to list, doesn't open Editor directly

2. **Fixed Upstream Production Documents**:
   - ✅ `dashboard/notebooks-interface.md` - Corrected creation workflow and field names
   - ✅ `references/glossary.md` - Fixed Editor interface description
   - ✅ `dashboard/templates-interface.md` - Removed drag-and-drop references

### Working Files
- **Quickstart being edited**: `/home/shawn/Code/prompts/EFN/Docs-staging/production/human-facing/quickstart-notebook-creators-edited.md`
- **Original quickstart**: `/home/shawn/Code/prompts/EFN/Docs-staging/production/human-facing/quickstart-notebook-creators.md`

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1: Quick Fixes)

### Correct the Quickstart Guide
The quickstart-notebook-creators-edited.md needs corrections at each workflow stage:

1. **Notebook Creation Section** (Lines 78-83) ✅ Already corrected:
   ```markdown
   1. **Name**: Type "My First Survey" 
   2. **Select team**: Use the dropdown (required)
   3. Ignore optional fields
   4. Click **Create Notebook**
   ```

2. **Post-Creation Navigation** (Lines 85-92) ✅ Already added:
   ```markdown
   After clicking 'Create Notebook':
   1. Go to end of list (may need pagination)
   2. Click on your new notebook
   3. Click **Actions** tab
   4. Click **Open in Editor**
   ```

3. **Editor Description** (Lines 94-112) ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-01):
   - ✅ Fixed save behavior references (lines 107, 159) - changed from "auto-save" to manual SAVE button
   - ✅ Interface description accurate: DESIGN/INFO tabs, "+" button, "ADD NEW FORM" button

4. **Adding Fields Workflow** (Lines 128-203) ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-01):
   - ✅ Removed ALL drag-and-drop references (5 instances fixed)
   - ✅ Changed to "Click on field type to add it to your form"
   - ✅ Updated all 5 field examples: TextField, Select, DateTime, MultipleTextField, TakePhoto
   - ✅ Fixed screenshot placeholder (line 77) from "Templates interface" to "Notebooks interface"

5. **Remaining Sections** - Need screenshot verification:
   - Field configuration details (verify actual configuration panel behavior)
   - Preview/testing process
   - Publishing/deployment workflow (Step 4, lines 230-301)
   - Template editing workflow (Step 5, line 340+)

## Best Practices for Teaching LLMs About Screenshots

### Effective Format for Presenting Screenshots to Claude Code:

1. **Show the actual image first** using Read tool on screenshot path
2. **Provide context** about what the screenshot demonstrates
3. **Use structured annotations**:
   ```markdown
   [SCREENSHOT: {description}
   - Key elements: {list visible UI elements}
   - User action: {what to do}
   - Expected outcome: {what happens}
   - Common issues: {confusion points}]
   ```

4. **Specify element positions**: top-right, center panel, bottom button bar
5. **Distinguish interactive vs display elements**
6. **Note platform differences** if applicable (mobile vs desktop)

### Example Screenshot Presentation:
```markdown
Screenshot: /path/to/screenshot.png
This shows the notebook creation dialog with:
- Name field (required)
- Team dropdown (required) 
- Optional template/JSON fields
- Create Notebook button at bottom
User should: Enter name, select team, click Create
Common issue: Forgetting to select team causes error
```

## Phase 2: Systematic Documentation (2-3 hours)

### 1. Screenshot Annotation Pipeline
- Use existing scripts in `human-facing/vision-pipeline-proposal.md`
- Process with llama3.2-vision:11b for basic analysis
- Use Gemini 2.5 Pro for complex workflows
- Generate structured markdown annotations

### 2. Documentation Updates Needed
- Add visual references to all interface documentation
- Create visual-elements-reference.md
- Update glossary with UI element descriptions
- Add screenshot placeholders with detailed annotations

### 3. Create LLM Teaching Document
- Compile all screenshot annotations
- Map UI elements to functionality
- Document common workflows with visual context
- Include error states and edge cases

## Technical Notes

### Screenshot Storage Structure
```
Docs-staging/
├── screenshots/
│   ├── quickstart-notebook-creators/
│   │   ├── screenshot-001-login.png
│   │   ├── screenshot-002-dashboard.png
│   │   └── ...
│   └── interface-reference/
└── analysis/
    └── quickstart-notebook-creators/
        ├── screenshot-001-analysis.md
        └── ...
```

### Key Commands
- Build reference: `./scripts/build-reference.sh`
- Never edit reference.md directly (it's generated)
- Edit source files in field-categories/, patterns/, references/

## Critical Issues to Remember

1. **Editor is NOT drag-and-drop** - It's a form builder with buttons
2. **Team selection is REQUIRED** - Not automatic
3. **No "Start from scratch" option exists**
4. **No Description field in notebook creation**
5. **Creating empty notebook doesn't open Editor** - Returns to list

## Session Log: 2025-10-01

### Completed Today
- ✅ Fixed Editor save behavior (2 references: lines 107, 159)
- ✅ Removed all drag-and-drop references from field addition instructions (5 fixes)
- ✅ Corrected screenshot placeholder mislabeling (Templates → Notebooks)
- ✅ Verified field type names in use: FAIMSTextField, Select, DateTime with Now button, MultipleTextField, TakePhoto

### Key Lessons Learned
1. **Critical Error Pattern**: Original quickstart made systemic assumption of drag-and-drop UI when actual interface uses click-to-add buttons
2. **Auto-save Assumption**: Multiple references to auto-save when Editor requires manual SAVE button clicks
3. **Terminology Consistency**: Need to verify ALL UI element references against actual interface, not assumptions

### Verified UI Behaviors (From Documentation Fixes)
- ✅ Editor uses SAVE button (not auto-save)
- ✅ Editor uses click-to-add fields (not drag-and-drop)
- ✅ Notebook Editor has DESIGN/INFO tabs, SAVE/CANCEL buttons, UNDO/REDO
- ✅ Field palette uses consistent naming: FAIMSTextField, MultipleTextField, TakePhoto

### Still Needs Verification (For Next Session)
- [ ] Field configuration panel: How does it open? What's the actual interaction?
- [ ] Form Settings: Where is it? Gear icon or menu?
- [ ] Deploy/publish workflow: Actual button names and sequence
- [ ] Template vs Notebook relationship: Can you edit notebooks directly or only through templates?
- [ ] Records view: How to access after creating a record?

## Next Session Starting Point (2025-10-02)

1. **Review today's changes** in quickstart-notebook-creators-edited.md
2. **Continue with Step 4** (Deploy and Test, lines 230-301):
   - Verify "Deploy" button existence and location
   - Check notebook access workflow after deployment
   - Validate record creation and save process
3. **Step 5 verification** (Collaborate and Refine, lines 303+):
   - Verify template editing workflow
   - Check if changes to templates really don't affect existing notebooks
4. **Use screenshot best practices** documented below
5. **Document any new UI discoveries** in this file
