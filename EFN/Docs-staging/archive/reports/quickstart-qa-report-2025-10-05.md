# QA Report: Quickstart Guide Comparison
## Phase 3 Systematic Analysis - 2025-10-05

**Generated**: 2025-10-05
**Analyst**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Documents Compared**:

- **Gold Standard**: `/home/shawn/Code/prompts/EFN/Docs-staging/production/human-facing/quickstart-creation-and-collection.md`
- **Regenerated**: `/home/shawn/Code/prompts/EFN/Docs-staging/production/human-facing/quickstart-regenerated-test-2025-10-05.md`

---

## Executive Summary

**VERDICT: CONDITIONAL PASS (68% Compliance)**

The regenerated quickstart guide demonstrates **significant improvements** in structural organization and progressive disclosure but contains **critical technical accuracy regressions** that would mislead users and create workflow-breaking errors. While the gold standard contains some inconsistencies, the regenerated version introduces new errors, particularly around workflow sequences, UI interactions, and field placement behaviour.

**Key Metrics**:

- Technical Accuracy: 50% (4/8 metrics passed)
- Structural Completeness: 75% (6/8 metrics passed)
- Quality Indicators: 83% (5/6 metrics passed)
- Overall Assessment: 68% compliance

**Critical Finding**: The regenerated guide creates a fundamentally incorrect workflow by directing users to create templates first, then "activate" them through an "Active (1)" status toggle—a feature that **does not exist** in Fieldmark's architecture. This represents a major conceptual misunderstanding that would block users from successfully completing the tutorial.

## Metric-by-Metric Analysis

### Technical Accuracy Metrics

#### ✓ Field component names match reference.md? **PASS**

**Gold Standard**: Correctly uses "FAIMS Text Field", "Select one option", "Date and Time with Now button", "Text Field", "Take Photo"

**Regenerated**: Uses "FAIMS Text Field", "Select Field", "Date and Time with Now button", "Text Field", "Take Photo"

**Analysis**: Minor discrepancy in "Select Field" vs "Select one option" but both are recognizable. Field component naming is substantially accurate in both versions.

---

#### ✗ Dashboard → Editor navigation workflows correct? **FAIL**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 78-110):

```markdown
1. Click **Notebooks** in the left navigation
2. Click **+ Create Notebook**
3. Name it "My First Survey"
4. Find notebook at END of list (lines 100-103: "It will appear at the end of the notebook list")
5. Click notebook name
6. Click Actions tab
7. Click Open in Editor
```

**Regenerated** (Lines 78-83):

```markdown
1. From your Dashboard, click **"Templates"** in the navigation
2. Click the **"Create Template"** button (usually green or prominent)
3. You'll see the **Notebook Editor** open - this is where the magic happens!
```

**Critical Error**: The regenerated version creates a **fundamentally different workflow** that:

- Starts in Templates (incorrect starting point)
- Claims Editor opens immediately after clicking Create Template (bypasses notebook creation dialog entirely)
- **Eliminates the entire notebook creation and navigation sequence**
- Creates confusion between notebooks and templates (they're different entities in Fieldmark)

This is a **workflow-breaking regression**.

---

#### ✗ UI element descriptions match screenshot evidence? **PARTIAL FAIL**

**Gold Standard**: Provides detailed UI descriptions with specific element locations:

- Lines 117-122: Describes top bar (CANCEL/SAVE), action buttons (UNDO/REDO below top bar), tab bar (DESIGN/INFO), "+" button, Form editing area
- Lines 53-58: Describes Dashboard layout with left sidebar, main content area, Create Notebook button

**Regenerated**: Uses generic descriptions:

- Lines 88-94: "three key areas" but lacks specificity about button placement
- Line 54: "Your user menu in the bottom-left (shows your initials)" — correct
- Line 55: "The main area where notebooks will appear" — vague

**Analysis**: Gold standard provides **screenshot-aligned descriptions** with precise UI element locations. Regenerated uses **generic descriptions** that don't match the detailed screenshot annotations promised.

**Screenshot Placeholder Format**:

- **Gold Standard**: Uses proper paths like `../screenshots/quickstart/final/quickstart-001-login.png`
- **Regenerated**: Uses bracketed placeholders like `[SCREENSHOT: Login page showing...]`

Both approaches are acceptable for this test, but gold standard shows production-ready formatting.

---

#### ✗ Modal overlay architecture (not separate page misconception)? **FAIL**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 215-219):

```markdown
1. **Click the "ADD A FIELD" button** (green button with plus icon)
2. **In the "Add a field" dialog that opens**:
   - **Field name**: Change "New Field" to **"Site Name"**
   - **Field type**: Click on **"FAIMS Text Field"** (single-line text input)
   - Click **"ADD FIELD"** button at bottom
```

Correctly describes "dialog that opens" as a modal overlay.

**Regenerated** (Lines 127-132):

```markdown
1. Click the green **"Add a Field"** button
2. You'll see field categories at the top - make sure **"TEXT"** is selected
3. In the field name box, type **"Site Name"**
4. Click the **"FAIMS Text Field"** card (single-line text input)
5. Click **"Add Field"** at the bottom
```

**Analysis**: Regenerated version **omits any mention** of a dialog/modal opening. This creates ambiguity about whether the field addition happens inline or in an overlay. Gold standard explicitly clarifies the modal architecture.

**Verdict**: **Regression** - removes important architectural context.

---

#### ✓ Save behaviour (manual vs. auto-save)? **PASS**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 415-425):

```markdown
**Important:** The Notebook Editor does not auto-save. Let's save your progress now.

1. **Click the green SAVE button** in the top-right corner
2. **You'll be returned to the Dashboard** - this is expected behavior
3. **To continue editing later**, simply click **"Open in Editor"** again

> ⚠️ **Remember to Save**: Get in the habit of clicking SAVE periodically as you work.
> The Editor will close and return you to the Dashboard each time you save...
```

Explicitly warns about manual save and Dashboard return behavior.

**Regenerated** (Lines 245, 369):

```markdown
1. Click the green **"Save"** button in the top-right corner
[No mention of auto-save or return-to-dashboard behavior]

4. Make your changes in the Notebook Editor
5. **Save** your changes
```

**Analysis**: Regenerated version **mentions saving** but fails to:

- Explicitly state NO auto-save
- Warn users they'll return to Dashboard after save
- Explain this is expected behaviour, not an error

**Verdict**: **PASS with caveats** - mentions manual save but omits critical context about post-save behaviour.

---

#### ✗ New item placement (end of list vs. beginning)? **FAIL**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 100-103):

```markdown
1. **Find your new notebook**:
   - It will appear at the end of the notebook list
   - **If you have many notebooks**: Look for pagination controls...
   - **Quick tip**: Use the search bar at the top of the list to search for "My First Survey"
```

Explicitly states notebooks appear **at the end of the list** and provides search/pagination guidance.

**Regenerated** (Lines 263-264):

```markdown
1. Click the **"Back"** button or arrow to return to your Dashboard
2. Find your notebook **"My First Site Survey"** in the list
```

**Critical Omission**: No mention of:

- Where in the list new notebooks appear
- Pagination handling for long lists
- Search functionality

**Analysis**: This is a **usability regression**. Users with 50+ notebooks will struggle to find their newly created notebook without this guidance.

---

#### ✓ Field selection workflow (6-tab modal dialog)? **PARTIAL PASS**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 245-247):

```markdown
- **Navigate to Choice fields**: Click the right chevron (>) next to the category tabs to see more options
- **Field type**: Click on **"Select one option"** (creates radio buttons)
```

Describes tab navigation with chevron controls.

**Regenerated** (Lines 141-142):

```markdown
2. Click the **"CHOICE"** category at the top
3. In the field name box, type **"Site Type"**
```

**Analysis**: Both describe categorical navigation. Gold standard provides more detail about **chevron navigation** to access additional tabs. Regenerated assumes all categories are visible without scrolling.

**Verdict**: **PASS** - both adequately describe the workflow, though gold standard is more comprehensive.

---

#### ✓ Collapsible panel interactions described? **PASS**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 221, 242, 297, 327, 359):

```markdown
3. **Click on the grey bar** to expand the field
1. **Collapse the Site Name field** - click on the grey bar to collapse it
```

Consistently describes expand/collapse interactions.

**Regenerated** (Lines 144, 204):

```markdown
6. Now you'll see the field appear - click the **arrow** next to "Site Type" to expand it
1. Scroll up and click **"Form Settings"** (the gear icon near the top)
2. The panel will expand...
```

**Analysis**: Both documents describe collapsible interfaces. Gold standard uses "grey bar" consistently; regenerated uses "arrow" and describes auto-expansion. Both are accurate.

**Verdict**: **PASS**

---

### Technical Accuracy Summary

**Passed**: 4/8 metrics (50%)

**Failed**: 4/8 metrics

- Dashboard → Editor workflow (critical)
- UI element specificity (major)
- Modal architecture description (minor)
- New item placement guidance (major)

**Verdict**: **PASS** - both provide validation guidance, different approaches.

---

#### ✗ Screenshot placeholders properly positioned? **PARTIAL PASS**

**Gold Standard**: 33 screenshot references with detailed alt-text descriptions and proper paths

```markdown
![Fieldmark login page with Email Address and Password fields, along with Sign in button and Continue with Google option](../screenshots/quickstart/final/quickstart-001-login.png)
```

**Regenerated**: 17 screenshot placeholders in bracket notation

```markdown
[SCREENSHOT: Login page showing email and password fields with green Sign in button]
```

**Analysis**: Gold standard has **94% more screenshots** (33 vs 17) with production-ready paths. Regenerated uses placeholder format acceptable for drafts but lacks:

- Proper markdown image syntax
- File paths for future screenshot insertion
- Screenshot reference numbers

**Verdict**: **PARTIAL PASS** - screenshots indicated but not production-ready.

---

**Gold Standard** (Line 64):

```markdown
- You see your name or email in the bottom-left user menu
- The Dashboard (right pane) shows navigation options like Notebooks, Templates, Users, Teams
- You see a list of notebooks in the main window
```

Specific, verifiable UI elements.

**Regenerated** (Lines 62-65):

```markdown
- [ ] You see your Dashboard with "Notebooks" or similar navigation
- [ ] Your user icon appears (usually in the bottom-left corner)
- [ ] The page title says "Fieldmark" or shows your instance name
```

Checkbox format, specific UI checks.

**Analysis**: Both provide **concrete, observable success criteria**. Regenerated adds checkbox format for user tracking.

**Verdict**: **PASS**

**Analysis**: Regenerated has **more structured troubleshooting** with a comprehensive dedicated section (lines 401-428) covering 7 common issues. Gold standard integrates troubleshooting contextually.

**Verdict**: **PASS** - regenerated exceeds expectations with dedicated section.

---

#### ✗ Time estimates realistic (25-35 min) or optimistic (15 min)? **FAIL**

**Gold Standard**: "Your First Notebook in 15 Minutes"

- Step 1: 2 minutes
- Step 2: 3 minutes
- Step 3: 5-7 minutes
- Step 4: 3 minutes
- **Total claimed**: 13-15 minutes

**Regenerated**: "Your First Notebook in 15 Minutes"

- Step 1: 2 minutes
- Step 2: 3 minutes
- Step 3: 5-7 minutes
- Step 4: 3 minutes
- Step 5: 2 minutes
- **Total claimed**: 15-17 minutes

**Reality Check**: Based on QA plan concerns about realistic completion times:

- Account setup/login: 3-5 min (if new user)
- Notebook creation + navigation: 5-8 min (finding in list)
- Adding 5 fields with configuration: 10-15 min
- Activation + record creation: 5-8 min
- **Realistic total**: 25-35 minutes for first-time users

**Analysis**: Both documents use **optimistic 15-minute framing** that doesn't account for:

- First-time user orientation time
- Pagination/search challenges
- Screenshot reference time
- Reading comprehension
- Trial and error

**Verdict**: **FAIL** - both documents share this unrealistic time estimate.

---

#### ✗ Error handling and troubleshooting included? **PARTIAL PASS**

**Gold Standard**: Inline error handling throughout

**Regenerated**: Dedicated section "Quick Troubleshooting" (lines 401-428) covering:

- Can't Find the Notebook Editor
- Fields Not Showing in the Form
- Save Button Missing or Disabled
- Can't Invite Team Members
- Photos Won't Upload
- Records Show "rec_xxxxx" Instead of Readable Names

**Analysis**: Regenerated has **superior troubleshooting structure** with dedicated section. However, gold standard has **more granular contextual troubleshooting** at each step.

**Verdict**: **PARTIAL PASS** - both approaches have merit; regenerated's consolidated section is more discoverable.

---

### Structural Completeness Summary

**Passed**: 6/8 metrics (75%)

**Failed**: 2/8 metrics

- Screenshot production-readiness (minor)
- Time estimate realism (shared issue)

---

**Analysis**: Both documents use **enthusiastic, supportive language** with celebration at milestones.

**Verdict**: **PASS**

---

#### ✓ Grade 8-9 readability maintained? **PASS**

**Analysis**: Both documents use:

- Short sentences
- Active voice
- Common vocabulary
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Analogies for technical concepts

Example from Regenerated (Lines 30-31):

```markdown
> 💡 **Pro tip**: Think of it like this - a notebook is like a blank form template,
> and records are the filled-in copies of that form.
```

Example from Gold Standard (Lines 143-152):

```markdown
Think of it like this:
- 📓 **Notebook** = Your entire survey or data collection project
- 📋 **Form** = A specific data entry screen
- 📂 **Section** = A group of related fields
- ✏️ **Form Field** = Individual data entry points
```

**Verdict**: **PASS** - both maintain accessible readability.

---

#### ✓ Encouragement and celebration at milestones? **PASS**

**Gold Standard**:

- Line 69: "Great! You're in. Now let's create something amazing."
- Line 114: "Fantastic! You're now in the Notebook Editor."
- Line 199: "Perfect! Now your form has a section..."

- Line 32: "customise" ✓
- Line 141: "organize" ✗ (should be "organise")
- Line 207: "organize" ✗
- Line 399: "Layout Style" context uses "organized" ✗

**Regenerated**: Consistent UK spelling

- Line 26: "customisable" ✓
- Line 90: "organised" ✓

**Analysis**: Gold standard has **3 instances of US spelling** ("organize"). Regenerated appears more consistent with UK spelling.

**Verdict**: **PASS** (with note that gold standard needs correction)

---

### Quality Indicator Summary

**Passed**: 5/6 metrics (83%)

**Failed**: 1/6 metric (time estimates - shared with structural metrics)

---

## Critical Issues (Workflow-Breaking Errors)

### 1. **CRITICAL: Incorrect Template-First Workflow**

**Location**: Regenerated lines 78-83

**Error**: Directs users to create Templates first, then implies Editor opens immediately

**Correct Flow** (from Gold Standard):

1. Notebooks → Create Notebook → Fill dialog → Return to list
2. Find notebook in list (at end)
3. Click notebook → Actions tab → Open in Editor

**Impact**: Users following regenerated guide will be **unable to complete tutorial** as described workflow doesn't exist.

**Recommendation**: Completely rewrite Step 2 to match gold standard's notebook-first workflow.

---

### 2. **CRITICAL: Non-Existent "Active (1)" Activation Workflow**

**Location**: Regenerated lines 244-257

**Error**:

```markdown
3. Give your notebook a name: **"My First Site Survey"**
4. Scroll down to the **"Active"** section
5. You'll see "Not Active (0)" - click **"Activate"**
6. A confirmation dialogue appears - click **"Activate"** again
7. Wait a moment - the status will change to **"Active (1)"**
```

**Gold Standard Activation** (Lines 441-463): Describes activation in the **mobile/data collection app**, not in the Editor/Dashboard. Users:

1. Navigate to `https://app.fieldmark.app`
2. Go to NOT ACTIVE tab
3. Click ACTIVATE button next to notebook
4. Confirm in modal
5. Notebook moves to ACTIVE tab

**Impact**: The "Active (1)" status toggle **does not exist** in the Fieldmark Editor. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the notebook activation architecture.

**Recommendation**: Replace entire activation section with gold standard's app-based activation workflow.

---

### 3. **MAJOR: Missing Pagination and Search Guidance**

**Location**: Regenerated line 264

**Omission**: No guidance on finding newly created notebooks in potentially long lists

**Impact**: Users with 50+ notebooks will fail to find their notebook, assume creation failed

**Recommendation**: Add explicit guidance (from gold standard lines 100-105) about:

- Notebooks appearing at end of list
- Using pagination controls
- Using search functionality

---

### 4. **MAJOR: Missing Dashboard Return After Save**

**Location**: Regenerated line 245

**Omission**: Doesn't warn that clicking SAVE returns user to Dashboard

**Impact**: Users will think Editor crashed when Dashboard appears after save

**Recommendation**: Add explicit warning (from gold standard lines 418-420):

> The Editor will close and return you to the Dashboard each time you save, but you can immediately click "Open in Editor" to resume editing.

---

## Major Deviations (Significant Accuracy Issues)

### 1. **Notebook vs Template Confusion**

**Regenerated** conflates notebooks and templates throughout, particularly in Step 2. **Fieldmark distinguishes**:

- **Templates**: Reusable notebook designs
- **Notebooks**: Instances created from templates (or created directly)

**Gold Standard** correctly uses "Create Notebook" workflow.

---

### 2. **Missing Form Creation Step**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 156-163): Explicit step to name form and click "ADD NEW FORM" button

**Regenerated**: Skips directly to form renaming without creating the form entity

**Impact**: Users may not understand the form-creation step if Editor doesn't auto-create default form.

---

### 3. **Radio Buttons vs Select Field**

**Gold Standard** (Line 246): Uses "Select one option" (creates radio buttons)

**Regenerated** (Line 142): Uses "Select Field" (creates dropdown)

**Impact**: Different field types with different UX. Radio buttons = all options visible; dropdown = click to reveal.

**Analysis**: Without reference.md confirmation, unclear which is correct, but gold standard's "Select one option" is more descriptive.

---

### 4. **Human-Readable ID Field Configuration Timing**

**Gold Standard** (Line 401): Configures HRID at end, in Form Settings panel

**Regenerated** (Lines 202-210): Presents HRID configuration as **critical step** mid-workflow with dramatic warning:

> This is **critical** - without this configuration, your records will display as confusing codes like "rec_a7f3b2c1"

**Analysis**: Both approaches work, but regenerated's **mid-workflow placement** may interrupt flow. However, its **emphatic warning** reduces likelihood of users missing this step.

**Verdict**: **Regenerated's approach is pedagogically superior** despite interrupting flow.

---

## Minor Deviations (Stylistic/Cosmetic)

### 1. **Emoji Usage**

**Gold Standard**: 5 emojis total (🚀 in title, celebration emojis at end)

**Regenerated**: 9 emojis (🚀 🎊 🎯 throughout)

**Analysis**: Both use emojis sparingly. No significant difference.

---

### 2. **Checkbox vs Bullet Success Criteria**

**Gold Standard**: Uses plain bullets for success criteria

**Regenerated**: Uses checkboxes `- [ ]` for interactive tracking

**Analysis**: Regenerated's checkbox format is **more interactive** and user-friendly for self-paced learning.

---

### 3. **Form Settings Description**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 391-406): Comprehensive Form Settings explanation with all 4 settings

**Regenerated** (Line 204): Simplified Form Settings focusing only on HRID

**Analysis**: Gold standard provides **more complete** Form Settings coverage. Regenerated simplifies but risks omitting useful configuration.

---

### 4. **Annotation and Uncertainty Feature Explanation**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 269-284): Detailed explanation with examples

**Regenerated**: Omitted entirely

**Analysis**: Gold standard better showcases **Fieldmark's unique features**. This is a **pedagogical omission** in regenerated version.

---

### 5. **Sync and Offline Architecture**

**Gold Standard** (Lines 475-481, 584-612): Comprehensive explanation of offline-first design, sync behaviour

**Regenerated** (Line 293): Brief mention of sync icon, minimal offline explanation

**Analysis**: Gold standard provides **architectural context** that helps users understand Fieldmark's value proposition. Regenerated omits this important conceptual grounding.

---

## Improvements (Regenerated Did Better)

### 1. **Structured Troubleshooting Section** ✓

**Regenerated** (Lines 401-428): Dedicated "Quick Troubleshooting" section covering 7 common issues

**Advantage**: More **discoverable** than gold standard's inline troubleshooting. Users can scan for their specific issue.

---

### 2. **Success Checklist** ✓

**Regenerated** (Lines 383-398): Comprehensive checkbox list of all achievements

**Advantage**: Provides **closure** and sense of accomplishment. Interactive format.

---

### 3. **Power User Tips Section** ✓

**Regenerated** (Lines 431-450): Advanced capabilities preview (virtual roles, API, conditional logic, template library)

**Advantage**: Shows **growth path** for advanced users without cluttering basic tutorial.

---

### 4. **Collaboration and Permissions Coverage** ✓

**Regenerated** (Lines 324-380): Detailed explanation of roles, team-based sharing

**Advantage**: Addresses **team collaboration** earlier in learning journey. Gold standard mentions teams but doesn't explain permission model.

---

### 5. **Clearer Field Type Naming** ✓

**Regenerated** (Line 180): Explicitly calls out naming confusion:

> The naming is confusing - "FAIMS Text Field" is for single lines, "Text Field" is for multiple lines!

**Advantage**: Proactively addresses **common confusion point**.

---

### 6. **Human-Readable ID Emphasis** ✓

**Regenerated** (Lines 202-210): Dramatic warning about HRID importance

**Advantage**: Ensures users don't miss this **critical configuration** step.

## Verdict

### Pass/Conditional/Fail Assessment

**CONDITIONAL PASS**

The regenerated guide **cannot be published in current form** due to:

1. **Critical workflow errors** (Template-first flow, non-existent activation)
2. **Missing architectural explanations** (two-URL system, offline-first, sync)
3. **Pedagogical omissions** (annotation/uncertainty features, Form Settings)

However, the regenerated guide demonstrates **significant structural improvements**:

1. Dedicated troubleshooting section
2. Success checklist
3. Power user tips
4. Collaboration and permissions coverage
5. Checkbox-based validation

### Percentage Assessment

**Technical Accuracy**: 50% (4/8 metrics)
**Structural Completeness**: 75% (6/8 metrics)
**Quality Indicators**: 83% (5/6 metrics)
**Overall**: **68% compliance**

### Recommendation

**DO NOT PUBLISH** regenerated version without **critical corrections**.

**Hybrid Approach Recommended**:

1. Use **gold standard's technical accuracy** (workflows, UI descriptions, architecture)
2. Adopt **regenerated's structural improvements** (troubleshooting section, checklist, power tips)
3. Merge **gold standard's pedagogical depth** (annotation/uncertainty, offline-first) with **regenerated's organization**

## Recommendations (Prioritized Fixes)

### Priority 1: Critical (Blocks Tutorial Completion)

1. **Rewrite Step 2 notebook creation workflow** to match gold standard's Notebooks → Create Notebook → Find in list → Open in Editor flow **(Lines 78-110 in regenerated)**

2. **Rewrite Step 4 activation workflow** to use app-based activation from gold standard, eliminating non-existent "Active (1)" toggle **(Lines 244-257 in regenerated)**

3. **Add pagination and search guidance** for finding newly created notebooks **(After line 264 in regenerated)**

4. **Add Dashboard return warning** when saving in Editor **(Line 245 in regenerated)**

---

### Priority 2: Major (Significant Usability Impact)

5. **Restore two-URL architecture explanation** (Dashboard vs App URLs) in "Before You Start" section

6. **Add explicit form creation step** before form renaming **(Lines 95-99 in regenerated)**

7. **Add section creation workflow** with explicit steps **(Missing entirely in regenerated)**

8. **Restore annotation and uncertainty feature explanation** in Field 2 (Site Type) configuration **(Lines 269-284 from gold standard)**

9. **Add comprehensive Form Settings** coverage beyond just HRID **(Lines 391-406 from gold standard)**

10. **Add offline-first architecture explanation** to activation section **(Lines 475-481 from gold standard)**

11. **Add Settings tab tour** covering sync controls **(Lines 584-612 from gold standard)**

---

### Priority 3: Minor (Quality and Completeness)

12. **Fix US spelling instances** in gold standard ("organize" → "organise") and verify regenerated maintains UK spelling

13. **Add more screenshots** (regenerated has 17, gold has 33) to match screenshot density

14. **Verify field type naming** against reference.md (radio buttons vs select dropdown for Site Type)

15. **Add sync icon visual explanation** with orange (not synced) vs green (synced) states

---

### Upstream Documentation Improvements

16. **Clarify notebook vs template distinction** in reference documentation

17. **Document the two-URL architecture** (Dashboard vs App) in system architecture docs

18. **Create activation workflow reference** to prevent future confusion

19. **Document new item placement behaviour** (end of list) in UI pattern library

20. **Standardize field type names** across reference.md and UI (e.g., "Select one option" vs "Select Field")

---

### Prompt Engineering Improvements

21. **Add explicit constraint**: "Notebooks are created from the Notebooks section, NOT the Templates section"

22. **Add explicit constraint**: "Activation occurs in the mobile app (app.fieldmark.app), NOT in the Editor"

23. **Add explicit constraint**: "New notebooks appear at the END of the list, requiring pagination or search to find"

24. **Add explicit constraint**: "Clicking SAVE in Editor returns user to Dashboard - this is expected behaviour"

25. **Add explicit constraint**: "Include all Form Settings (Finish Button Behaviour, Layout Style, Summary Fields, HRID), not just HRID"

26. **Add reference requirement**: "Include Fieldmark's unique annotation and uncertainty features in field configuration examples"

27. **Add reference requirement**: "Explain offline-first architecture and sync behaviour in activation section"

---

## Conclusion

The regenerated quickstart guide represents a **mixed outcome**:

**Strengths**:

- Superior structural organization (troubleshooting, checklist, power tips)
- Better collaboration and permissions coverage
- More discoverable help content
- Interactive checkbox format

**Critical Weaknesses**:

- Fundamental workflow errors (Template-first, non-existent activation)
- Missing architectural explanations (two-URL system, offline-first)
- Pedagogical omissions (annotation/uncertainty, comprehensive Form Settings)
- Inadequate pagination/search guidance

**Verdict**: **CONDITIONAL PASS (68%)** - promising structure, critical accuracy failures.

**Action Required**: Apply Priority 1-2 corrections before any publication consideration. Consider hybrid approach merging gold standard's technical accuracy with regenerated's structural improvements.
