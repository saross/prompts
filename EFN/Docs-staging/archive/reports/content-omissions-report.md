# Content Omissions Report: Source vs Generated Documentation

## Executive Summary

The generated documentation captures approximately **65-70%** of the source content. While core functionality and basic usage patterns are well-covered, significant technical details, platform-specific behaviors, and advanced implementation guidance are missing.

## Critical Omissions by Category

### 1. Technical Architecture Details ❌
**Missing across ALL fields:**
- Component implementation specifics (Material-UI wrapping, Formik integration)
- Rendering pipeline details (no memoization notes, DOM structure)
- Performance optimization strategies
- Memory usage patterns

### 2. Platform-Specific Behaviors ⚠️ Partial
**Checkbox**: Missing pixel-specific touch targets (24×24px icon, 48×48px target)
**MultiSelect**: Missing mode-specific thresholds (≤15 for checklist, >15 for dropdown)
**RadioGroup**: Missing iOS vs Android behavioral differences
**Select**: Missing native picker details for mobile platforms
**AdvancedSelect**: Missing specific mobile scrolling problems (500px fixed width)

### 3. Named Implementation Examples ❌
**Missing examples:**
- Checkbox: "Data Quality Indicator", "Migration from RadioGroup"
- MultiSelect: "Basic Multi-Selection", "Exclusive Options Pattern", "Dropdown for Long Lists"
- RadioGroup: "Heritage Condition Assessment", "Binary Choice alternatives"
- Select: "Site Classification", "Condition Assessment with Null"
- AdvancedSelect: "Biological Taxonomy", "Archaeological Context", "Geographic Location"

### 4. Troubleshooting Tables ⚠️ Partial
Source documents include detailed tables with columns:
- Issue | Symptoms | **Diagnosis** | Resolution | **Prevention**

Generated doc simplified to:
- Issue | Cause | Solution | Prevention

Missing the "Diagnosis" step and detailed symptoms descriptions.

### 5. Data Storage & Export Specifications ❌
**Missing from all fields:**
- Database storage formats and types
- CSV export limitations and escaping rules
- JSON export structure details
- Null/undefined handling specifics
- Audit trail limitations

### 6. Migration Procedures ⚠️ Partial
**Present**: General migration strategies
**Missing**: Step-by-step migration code examples, data transformation scripts, specific field conversion patterns

### 7. Debug Checklists ❌
Each source has 6-10 item debug checklists. Generated doc has generic checklists without field-specific items.

### 8. Cross-References & Dependencies ❌
Source documents extensively cross-reference related fields. Generated doc lacks these relationships.

## Field-Specific Critical Omissions

### Checkbox
- **State transition diagram** with all 4 states
- **Performance limits** (20-30 acceptable, 50+ degraded, 100+ unusable)
- **Legacy RadioGroup conversion** detailed steps
- **Data persistence patterns** with meta fields

### MultiSelect
- **Exclusive option interaction flow** (6-step process)
- **Performance breakdown by platform** (Desktop/iOS/Android tables)
- **Touch target specifications** per display mode
- **Keyboard navigation limitations** (no Shift/Ctrl selection)

### RadioGroup (Deprecated)
- **Comprehensive deprecation rationale** with specific WCAG violations
- **Migration urgency indicators** 
- **Accessibility failure details** (7 specific ARIA violations)
- **Performance degradation curves**

### Select
- **Designer advantage documentation** (only field with label preservation)
- **Native picker behaviors** per platform
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Alt+Down, typing to jump)
- **Empty option best practices**

### AdvancedSelect (Beta)
- **Node structure specifications** with depth limits
- **Performance boundaries** (50 nodes optimal, 500+ unusable)
- **Path parsing vulnerabilities** with " > " delimiter
- **Hierarchy flattening algorithms**

## Validation Documentation Gaps

### Missing Validation Tables
Source documents include comprehensive validation operator tables showing:
- Operator | Configuration | Behavior | Edge Cases | Notes

Generated doc lacks the edge cases and detailed notes columns.

### Missing Validation Timing
Source documents specify validation lifecycle:
- On mount behavior
- On change behavior  
- On blur behavior
- On submit behavior

Generated doc mentions validation but not the timing specifics.

## Recommendations for Resolution

### Priority 1: Critical Technical Gaps
1. Add platform-specific behavior tables
2. Include performance thresholds with specific numbers
3. Add debug checklists for each field

### Priority 2: Implementation Examples
1. Add ALL named examples from source docs
2. Include migration pattern examples with code
3. Add troubleshooting scenarios with solutions

### Priority 3: Architecture & Storage
1. Document data storage formats
2. Add export format specifications
3. Include technical architecture notes

### Estimated Additional Content
- **Lines to add**: ~800-1000
- **Examples to add**: 15 named examples
- **Tables to add**: 8-10 detailed tables
- **Cross-references**: 20+ links

## Conclusion

The generated documentation provides good coverage of basic functionality but lacks the depth needed for:
- Complex implementations
- Platform-specific deployments
- Migration scenarios
- Performance optimization
- Troubleshooting edge cases

The missing ~30-35% represents critical implementation details that developers need for production deployments.
