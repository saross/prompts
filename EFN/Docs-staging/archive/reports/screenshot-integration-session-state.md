# Screenshot Integration Session State
**Date**: 2025-10-02/03
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete, Ready for Phase 2

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Quickstart Guide v1 Refinements ✅
Applied all improvements from `quickstart-effectiveness-assessment-2025-10-02.md`:

**File**: `production/human-facing/quickstart-creation-and-collection.md`

**Changes Made**:
- **URLs Clarified** (lines 20-25): Added distinction between Dashboard URL (`https://dashboard.fieldmark.app`) and Data Collection App URL (`https://app.fieldmark.app`)
- **Terminology Fixed**: "Dashboard" throughout (NOT "Control Centre" - that was test environment)
- **UUID Definition Expanded** (line 390): Now explains "opaque, computer-generated identifiers (UUIDs)"
- **Collapsed Fields**: Changed from conditional "If collapsed..." to direct "Click on grey bar to expand"
- **Team Selection Enhanced** (lines 90-92): Added pre-selection behavior explanation
- **UNDO/REDO Tip Added** (lines 118-120): Location corrected - below top bar, above tabs (NOT in top bar)
- **Resume Editing Tip** (line 423): How to resume via Dashboard → Actions → Open in Editor
- **Offline-First Section** (lines 475-481): New section explaining activation and local storage
- **Conflict Resolution** (line 579): Mentioned in sync callout
- **Wayfinding Improved** (lines 99-105): Pagination and search guidance for finding notebooks
- **Verbosity Reduced**:
  - Editor Interface: 7 bullets → 4 bullets (lines 110-114)
  - Empty Table: Less exhaustive column listing (lines 488-496)

**REFRESH RECORDS Clarified** (code investigation in FAIMS3 repo):
- Does NOT initiate sync (sync is automatic)
- DOES refresh displayed list from local database
- Useful for viewing records that synced in the background
- Updated both mentions (lines 491, 577-579)

**Word Count**: 5,309 (within acceptable range)

**Commits**:
- `a0e5a55` - v1 refinements
- `[hash]` - Terminology fix (Control Centre → Dashboard)
- `[hash]` - UNDO/REDO location & REFRESH RECORDS functionality

### 2. Screenshot Integration Setup ✅

**Directory Structure Created**:
```
/Docs-staging/production/
  /screenshots/
    /quickstart/
      /raw/          # 33 original screenshots (resized)
      /final/        # Will contain renamed, ready-to-use
    /analysis/       # Vision model outputs
    /reports/        # Comparison reports
```

**Screenshots Organized**:
- Copied 33 screenshots from `/home/shawn/Pictures/Screenshots/` (Oct 1-2)
- Resized all to max 2000px dimension using ImageMagick
  - 24 resized, 9 already within limits
  - Script saved: `/production/scripts/resize-screenshots.sh`

**Placeholder Count**: 32 screenshot placeholders in quickstart doc

## Approved Plan: Hybrid Pilot Approach

### Goal
Test multiple vision models to establish best workflow for large-scale documentation.

### Phases

**Phase 1: Setup** ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] Screenshots copied and resized
- [ ] Extract placeholder list to tracking file

**Phase 2: Claude Vision Analysis** (NEXT)
- [ ] Analyze all 33 screenshots with Claude vision
- [ ] Match to 32 placeholders
- [ ] Generate gap report (which match, which need retakes, why)
- User reviews and decides retakes

**Phase 3: Screenshot Retakes** (User Task)
- Capture any missing/incorrect screenshots
- Follow naming: `quickstart-001-dashboard-urls.png`
- Browser: 1280x800, clean state, exact doc match

**Phase 4: Model Comparison** (Overnight)
- Test A: Claude vision analysis (fast, API)
- Test B: qwen2.5-vl:72b local (slower, available)
- Compare: accuracy, completeness, annotation quality, speed

**Phase 5: Integration**
- Rename screenshots with final convention
- Update markdown placeholders
- Add alt text from vision analysis

**Phase 6: Automation Scripts**
- Create production-ready scripts based on learnings
- Document workflow for future docs

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Terminology**: "Dashboard" is correct (not Control Centre)
2. **URL Format**: `https://dashboard.fieldmark.app` (was showing `api.fieldmark.app` in some places)
3. **UNDO/REDO Location**: Below top bar, above tabs (user corrected from screenshot)
4. **REFRESH RECORDS**: Only refreshes view, doesn't trigger sync
5. **Pilot Approach**: Hybrid testing to compare Claude vs local qwen2.5-vl:72b

## Screenshot Placeholders (32 total)

Line references in `quickstart-creation-and-collection.md`:
- 25: URLs comparison (Dashboard vs Data Collection App)
- 49: Login page
- 59: Dashboard Overview
- 84: Notebooks interface
- 105: Pagination controls (NEW)
- 115: Notebook Editor interface
- 128: UNDO/REDO buttons (NEW - below top bar)
- 163-378: Field creation workflow (12 screenshots)
- 387-403: Form Settings (2 screenshots)
- 441-464: Activation workflow (4 screenshots)
- 497-582: Data collection & sync (6 screenshots)
- 590: Settings tab

## Next Session Actions

1. **Extract placeholder list** to CSV/JSON for tracking
2. **Run Claude vision analysis** on all 33 screenshots
3. **Generate gap report**:
   - Which screenshots match which placeholders
   - Which are perfect matches
   - Which need retakes (and why)
   - Which placeholders have no screenshot yet
4. **User reviews report** and captures any needed retakes
5. **Set up qwen2.5-vl:72b** overnight comparison test
6. **Compare results** and document findings

## Important Context

- This is a **pilot** for eventual large-scale screenshot integration
- Testing automation to determine best approach (Claude vs local models)
- User has qwen2.5-vl:72b available locally (slower but free)
- Goal: efficient, accurate workflow for ~200+ screenshots across all docs
- Success metrics: time saved, accuracy, consistency

## Commands to Resume

```bash
# View screenshots
ls -lh /home/shawn/Code/prompts/EFN/Docs-staging/production/screenshots/quickstart/raw/

# Count placeholders
grep -c '\[SCREENSHOT' production/human-facing/quickstart-creation-and-collection.md

# Extract placeholders
grep -n '\[SCREENSHOT' production/human-facing/quickstart-creation-and-collection.md

# Resize any new screenshots
/home/shawn/Code/prompts/EFN/Docs-staging/production/scripts/resize-screenshots.sh [directory]
```

## User's Question Before Bed
"Can you write a script to resize images over 2000px?" → ✅ Done, working perfectly
