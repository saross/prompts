# QA Test: Automated Quickstart Documentation Generation

**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Ready to Execute
**Purpose**: Validate upstream documentation quality enables automated human-facing doc generation

---

## Objective

Test whether the updated upstream LLM-first documentation (reference.md) can automatically generate high-quality human-facing quickstart guides without extensive human curation.

---

## Test Setup

### Gold Standard Baseline

- **File**: `production/human-facing/quickstart-creation-and-collection.md`
- **Status**: Curated through extensive review, screenshot verification, and error correction
- **Quality**: 8.5/10 effectiveness (documented in quickstart-effectiveness-assessment-2025-10-02.md)
- **Lines**: ~660 lines, ~5,000 words
- **Screenshots**: 34 integrated with accessibility alt text

### Test Resources

- **Source**: Freshly rebuilt `production/reference.md` (38,481 lines, 1,738 template markers)
- **Template**: `production/prompts/quickstart-generation-prompt.md`
- **Visual Context**: 34 screenshots from `production/screenshots/quickstart/final/`
- **Constraint**: Zero human intervention during generation

### Context

Session 4 just completed comprehensive upstream corrections:
- Fixed modal overlay architecture (not separate pages)
- Corrected save behaviour (manual, not auto-save)
- Fixed new item placement (end of lists, not beginning)
- Corrected field selection workflow (6-tab modal dialog)
- Added collapsible panel interaction patterns
- Applied UK/Australian English spelling
- Fixed markdown linting compliance

---

## Test Process

### Phase 1: Baseline Verification ✅ Complete

- ✅ reference.md rebuilt successfully: 38,481 lines, 0 errors, 0 warnings
- ✅ All upstream corrections from Session 4 integrated
- ✅ UI patterns documented in ui-interaction-patterns.md
- ✅ Build script consolidated with validation features

### Phase 2: Test Generation (15-20 minutes)

**Steps:**

1. Load `production/reference.md` into fresh LLM context
2. Provide all 34 screenshots from `production/screenshots/quickstart/final/`
3. Execute `production/prompts/quickstart-generation-prompt.md` verbatim
4. Save raw output as `production/human-facing/quickstart-regenerated-test-2025-10-05.md`
5. **Critical**: No mid-generation corrections or guidance

**Screenshot Decision**: **INCLUDE** all 34 screenshots
- Reflects actual production workflow (comprehensive library planned)
- Tests visual context integration
- More realistic assessment of generation quality
- Screenshot captions provide UI verification context

### Phase 3: Systematic Comparison (30-45 minutes)

Compare regenerated guide against gold standard using these metrics:

#### Technical Accuracy Metrics

- ✓ Field component names match reference.md?
- ✓ Dashboard → Editor navigation workflows correct?
- ✓ UI element descriptions match screenshot evidence?
- ✓ Modal overlay architecture (not separate page misconception)?
- ✓ Save behaviour (manual vs. auto-save)?
- ✓ New item placement (end of list vs. beginning)?
- ✓ Field selection workflow (6-tab modal dialog)?
- ✓ Collapsible panel interactions described?

#### Structural Completeness Metrics

- ✓ All required sections from template present?
- ✓ "✓ You'll Know It Worked When..." validation blocks?
- ✓ Screenshot placeholders properly positioned?
- ✓ Success criteria observable and concrete?
- ✓ Pro tips and warnings included?
- ✓ Troubleshooting sections present?

#### Quality Indicator Metrics

- ✓ Time estimates realistic (25-35 min) or optimistic (15 min)?
- ✓ Error handling and troubleshooting included?
- ✓ Confidence-building language present?
- ✓ Grade 8-9 readability maintained?
- ✓ Encouragement and celebration at milestones?
- ✓ UK/Australian English spelling?

#### Deviation Analysis Categories

**Additions**: Content in regenerated not in gold standard
- Novel explanations or improvements
- Additional context or examples
- Extra troubleshooting guidance

**Omissions**: Gold standard content missing from regenerated
- Missing sections or subsections
- Skipped validation checkpoints
- Absent troubleshooting notes

**Regressions**: Errors we fixed during curation reappearing
- Auto-save assumptions
- Drag-drop instead of click-based workflows
- Separate page instead of modal overlay
- Beginning of list instead of end placement

**Improvements**: Better explanations than gold standard
- Clearer workflows
- Better success criteria
- Enhanced troubleshooting

### Phase 4: Root Cause Analysis (15-20 minutes)

Categorise issues into:

1. **Upstream documentation gaps** → Fix in field-categories/, references/, dashboard/, etc.
   - Missing information in reference.md
   - Ambiguous or unclear guidance
   - Contradictory information

2. **Generation prompt deficiencies** → Refine quickstart-generation-prompt.md
   - Unclear instructions
   - Missing requirements
   - Insufficient examples

3. **LLM limitations** → Accept or document workarounds
   - Inherent model constraints
   - Context interpretation challenges
   - Hallucination patterns

Create prioritised fix list with impact ratings:
- **Critical**: Workflow-breaking errors
- **Major**: Significant accuracy issues
- **Minor**: Stylistic or cosmetic issues

---

## Success Criteria

### Pass: Minimal Edits Required (<10% of content)

- Technical accuracy: 95%+
- Structural completeness: 100%
- No critical workflow-breaking errors
- Minor stylistic adjustments only

**Outcome**: Automated generation validated as production-ready

### Conditional Pass: Moderate Curation Needed (10-30% of content)

- Technical accuracy: 80-94%
- Structural issues addressable
- Minor workflow clarifications needed
- Targeted upstream fixes identified

**Outcome**: System validated with identified improvements needed

### Fail: Extensive Rework Required (>30% of content)

- Critical technical errors present
- Major structural gaps
- Workflow-breaking mistakes
- Systemic documentation issues

**Outcome**: Significant upstream documentation overhaul needed

---

## Deliverables

1. **quickstart-regenerated-test-2025-10-05.md**
   - Raw generated output (no edits)
   - Saved in `production/human-facing/`

2. **quickstart-qa-report-2025-10-05.md**
   - Detailed comparison analysis
   - Metric-by-metric assessment
   - Categorised deviations
   - Pass/Conditional/Fail verdict
   - Saved in `production/human-facing/`

3. **upstream-corrections-list-2025-10-05.md** (if needed)
   - Prioritised list of reference.md fixes
   - Specific files and sections to update
   - Impact ratings for each fix
   - Saved in `planning/`

## Expected Outcomes

### Best Case Scenario

Validates that Session 4 upstream corrections enable high-quality automated generation, proving:
- Documentation system effectiveness
- Quality cascade approach works
- Screenshot-verified corrections propagate correctly
- Automated generation is production-viable

### Worst Case Scenario

Identifies remaining gaps in upstream docs for targeted improvement:
- Specific documentation weaknesses exposed
- Clear roadmap for fixes
- Validates QA process itself
- Informs future documentation standards

**Either outcome advances documentation quality and automation capabilities.**

---

## Test Environment

- **LLM Model**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- **Context Window**: 200K tokens
- **Generation Mode**: Single-pass, zero intervention
- **Reference Source**: production/reference.md (build date: 2025-10-05)
- **Template Version**: quickstart-generation-prompt.md (current)

---

## Notes

- This test validates the entire documentation pipeline: upstream → reference.md → human-facing
- Success proves that quality improvements at the upstream level propagate correctly
- Test is repeatable: can re-run after upstream fixes to measure improvement
- Results inform both documentation content and generation process refinement

---

## Next Steps After Test

1. **If Pass**: Document successful automated generation process, create workflow documentation
2. **If Conditional**: Implement upstream fixes, re-test, iterate
3. **If Fail**: Analyse root causes, plan systematic documentation review, define improvement roadmap

*This QA test represents a critical validation of the LLM-first documentation approach and automated generation capability.*
