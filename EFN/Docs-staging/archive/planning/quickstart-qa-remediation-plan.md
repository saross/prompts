✅ **Realistic Time Estimates**: Update from 15 min to 25-30 min
✅ **Optional Sections**: Troubleshooting/Pro Tips clearly marked as supplementary

---

## Priority 1: Critical Upstream Source File Fixes (4 Issues)

### 1.1 Notebook-First Workflow Documentation

**Problem**: LLM chose template-first workflow (incorrect for beginners)
**Root Cause**: Pedagogical guidance exists (line 32298 of reference.md) but buried in meta-documentation section; primary workflow sections give equal weight to both approaches

**Files to Update**:

#### A. `production/dashboard/templates-interface.md`
Add at beginning of Templates section:
```markdown
## Pedagogical Note for Documentation Writers {meta}

**For NEW USERS**: We recommend creating notebooks directly first, then converting proven
notebooks to templates later. Template-first creation is an advanced workflow for experienced
users building reusable patterns.

**Beginner Path**: Notebooks → Create Notebook → Field-test → Convert to Template (optional)
**Advanced Path**: Templates → Create Template → Deploy Notebooks

See [template-workflow-principle.md](../references/template-workflow-principle.md) for
detailed rationale.
```

#### B. `production/dashboard/notebooks-interface.md`
Add at beginning of Notebooks section:
```markdown
## Recommended Workflow for Beginners {important}

**This is the RECOMMENDED starting point for new users.** Creating notebooks directly allows
immediate field-testing and iterative refinement. Once you've proven your design, you can
optionally convert it to a template for reuse.

**Workflow**: Create Notebook → Test in field → Refine → Optional: Convert to Template
```

#### C. `production/references/template-workflow-principle.md`
This file already exists with excellent guidance. Update to add:
```markdown
## Implementation for LLM Documentation

When generating quickstart or beginner documentation:

1. **ALWAYS direct users to Notebooks → Create Notebook** (not Templates)
2. **Mark template creation as "Advanced" or "Optional"**
3. **Show template conversion at end as next step**, not as primary workflow
4. **Use inline markers**: "RECOMMENDED FOR BEGINNERS" vs "Advanced Workflow"
```

### 1.2 Activation Workflow Documentation

**Problem**: LLM described non-existent "Active (1)" toggle in Editor
**Root Cause**: Activation architecture (mobile app vs Editor) not explicitly documented

**Files to Update**:

#### A. Create `production/dashboard/activation-workflow.md`
```markdown
# Notebook Activation Workflow {essential}

## Architecture Overview

Notebook **activation** occurs in the **mobile/data collection app** (app.fieldmark.app),
NOT in the Editor or Dashboard.

**Critical**: There is NO "Active" or "Active (1)" toggle in the Notebook Editor's Info tab.
This is a common documentation error.

## Activation Process

1. Navigate to data collection app: `https://app.fieldmark.app`
2. Log in with same credentials as Dashboard
3. Click **NOT ACTIVE** tab (shows notebooks available for activation)
4. Find your notebook in the list
5. Click green **ACTIVATE** button
6. Confirm in modal dialog
7. Notebook moves to **ACTIVE** tab

## What Activation Does

- Downloads notebook structure to device for offline use
- Downloads existing records (if any) to local database
- Enables offline data collection
- Starts background sync when online

## Troubleshooting

- **Notebook doesn't appear**: Check permissions, verify same login credentials
- **Activation fails**: Ensure stable internet connection
- **Can't deactivate**: Feature coming soon (current limitation)

## See Also

- [Offline-First Architecture](../references/platform-reference.md#offline-first)
- [Sync Behaviour](./notebooks-interface.md#sync-settings)
```

#### B. Update `production/dashboard/notebooks-interface.md`
Add cross-reference in deployment section:
```markdown
## Deploying Notebooks for Data Collection

After creating a notebook in the Editor, you must **activate** it in the mobile app
to collect data.

**See**: [Activation Workflow](./activation-workflow.md) for complete activation process.

**Important**: Activation occurs in the mobile app (app.fieldmark.app), NOT in the Dashboard.
```

### 1.3 List Behaviour Patterns

**Problem**: No guidance that new notebooks appear at END of list
**Root Cause**: UI behaviour pattern not documented

**File to Update**: `production/references/ui-interaction-patterns.md`

Add new section:
```markdown
## 13. List Item Placement Behaviour {important}

### New Items Appear at End of Lists

When creating new notebooks or templates in the Dashboard, the newly created item appears
at the **END of the list**, not at the beginning (top).

**User Impact**:
- Users with many notebooks (50+) will need to navigate to find their new item
- Pagination controls required for long lists
- Search functionality is essential

### Finding Newly Created Items

**Recommend documenting these steps**:

1. **Use Search**: Type the notebook name in the search bar at top of list
2. **Use Pagination**: Click through pages to reach the end of the list
3. **Check Counter**: "Page X of Y" shows total pages to navigate

**Example for Quickstart**:
```
After clicking "Create Notebook", you return to the notebook list. Your new notebook
appears at the END of the list.

**To find it**:
- If you have many notebooks: Use pagination controls at bottom ("1-10 of 50 notebooks")
- Click through to last page, or use search bar to search for "My First Survey"
```

### Pagination Controls

Located at bottom-right of list tables:
- "1-10 of 50 notebooks" (shows current range and total)
- Arrow buttons (< >) to navigate pages
- Rows per page selector (25, 50, 100)

## 14. Save Behaviour in Notebook Editor {important}

### Editor Closes and Returns to Dashboard

The Notebook Editor does NOT auto-save. When you click the **SAVE** button:

1. Editor validates and saves changes
2. Editor **closes** (this is expected behaviour)
3. You are **returned to the Dashboard** (notebooks or templates list)

**User Impact**: First-time users may think the Editor crashed when it closes after save.

### Documentation Pattern

Always warn users about this behaviour:
```
**Important**: The Notebook Editor does not auto-save. Click SAVE periodically to preserve
your work.

**Expected Behaviour**: When you click SAVE, the Editor will close and return you to the
Dashboard. This is normal - your changes are saved. To continue editing, click "Open in
Editor" again from the Actions tab.
```

### Resume Editing After Save

1. Return to Notebooks (or Templates) list
2. Click on the notebook/template name
3. Click **Actions** tab
4. Click **Open in Editor**
```

### 1.4 Form/Section Creation Workflow

**Problem**: Regenerated guide skipped explicit section creation step
**Root Cause**: Form → Section → Field hierarchy not clearly documented

**File to Update**: `production/references/editor-form-settings.md` (or create `production/patterns/editor-workflow-patterns.md`)

Add to beginning:
```markdown
## Editor Workflow: Form → Section → Field Hierarchy {essential}

### Structure Overview

Notebooks contain:
- **Forms** (viewsets) → organize different data entry screens
- **Sections** → group related fields within a form
- **Fields** → individual data entry points

### Creation Sequence

1. **Create Form**:
   - Enter form name in "Form Name" field
   - Click green "ADD NEW FORM" button
   - Form created with badge showing form name

2. **Create Section** (within form):
   - Enter section name in "Section Name" field
   - Click "+" button
   - Section created with numbered badge (1, 2, 3...)

3. **Add Fields** (within section):
   - Click "ADD A FIELD" button
   - Modal dialog opens with field type categories
   - Select field type, configure, click "ADD FIELD"

**Critical for Documentation**: Don't skip the section creation step. Users need to explicitly
create a section before adding fields.
```

---

## Priority 2: Update Gold Standard Guide

**File**: `production/human-facing/quickstart-creation-and-collection.md`

### 2.1 Fix Time Estimates Throughout

```markdown
Title: "Your First Notebook in 25-30 Minutes 🚀" (from "15 Minutes")

Step 1: Access Your Dashboard (3-5 minutes)  [from 2 min]
Step 2: Create Your First Notebook (5-8 minutes)  [from 3 min]
Step 3: Add Your Fields (8-12 minutes)  [from 5-7 min]
Step 4: Activate and Test Your Notebook (5-8 minutes)  [from 3 min]

Total: 21-33 minutes (realistic range)
Title claim: 25-30 minutes (middle of range)
```

### 2.2 Reduce to 3 Fields

**Current**: 5 fields (Site Name, Site Type, Survey Date, Observations, Site Photo)
**New**: 3 fields

**Keep**:
1. **Site Name** (FAIMS Text Field) - Basic text input, required field, HRID configuration
2. **Site Type** (Select one option) - Choice field with radio buttons, demonstrates annotation/uncertainty features
3. **Site Photo** (Take Photo) - Media field, demonstrates file/photo capture

**Remove**:
- Survey Date (DateTimeNow) - defer to "try more field types"
- Observations (Text Field/multiline) - defer to "try more field types"

**Rationale**: Three fields demonstrate all major categories (text, choice, media) while reducing configuration time by ~4-6 minutes.

### 2.3 Add Structural Improvements from Regenerated Version

#### A. Add Success Checklist (Before Troubleshooting)

```markdown
## Success Checklist

Congratulations! 🎊 Let's review everything you've accomplished:

- [ ] Logged in to Fieldmark and accessed your Dashboard
- [ ] Created a new notebook using the Notebook Editor
- [ ] Added three fields: text, choice, and photo
- [ ] Configured the Human-Readable ID Field (critical step!)
- [ ] Activated your notebook in the mobile app
- [ ] Created and saved your first record
- [ ] Saw your record display properly in the records list
- [ ] Understand how to edit and improve your notebook

**If you've ticked all these boxes, you're officially a Fieldmark notebook creator!** 🎯
```

#### B. Add Dedicated Troubleshooting Section

```markdown
## Troubleshooting {optional-reference}

> 💡 **Note**: This section is optional reference material. Most users won't encounter these
> issues. Refer to this section if you get stuck.

### Can't Find the Notebook Editor

**Solution**: Look for "Notebooks" in your navigation, click "Create Notebook", then find your
notebook at the end of the list. Click the notebook name → Actions tab → Open in Editor. If
you don't see this option, check with your administrator about permissions.

### Notebook Not in List After Creation

**Solution**: New notebooks appear at the END of the list, not the beginning. Use pagination
controls at the bottom ("1-10 of X notebooks") to navigate to the last page, or use the
search bar to find your notebook by name.

### Fields Not Showing in the Form

**Solution**: Make sure you clicked "ADD FIELD" at the bottom of the dialogue. Also check that
fields are in "Visible Fields" not "Hidden Fields" in the editor.

### Editor Closed After Clicking Save

**This is expected behaviour**: The Editor does not auto-save. Clicking SAVE closes the Editor
and returns you to the Dashboard. Your work is saved. To resume editing: find your notebook
in the list → Actions → Open in Editor.

### Records Show "rec_xxxxx" Instead of Readable Names

**Solution**: This is the most common issue! Go back to editing your notebook. Open Form
Settings and set the "Human-Readable ID Field" to "Site Name". Save the changes. New records
will display properly (existing records will keep the old format).

### Notebook Not Appearing in Mobile App

**Solution**: Make sure you're logged into the mobile app (app.fieldmark.app) with the same
credentials you used in the Dashboard. If you still don't see it, check with your administrator
about team permissions.

### Photos Won't Upload

**Solution**: On mobile, check camera permissions in your device settings. On desktop, the Take
Photo field works best on mobile devices.
```

#### C. Convert Validation Blocks to Checkbox Format

Change from:
```markdown
### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- You see your name or email in the bottom-left user menu
- The Dashboard shows navigation options
```

To:
```markdown
### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...
- [ ] You see your name or email in the bottom-left user menu
- [ ] The Dashboard shows navigation options
```

#### D. Add Progress Check Callouts

After completing 3-field section:
```markdown
> ✓ **Progress Check**: You should now see three fields in your Visible Fields list:
> Site Name, Site Type, and Site Photo. Each shows its field type badge. You're doing great!
```

#### E. Add Dramatic HRID Warning

In Form Settings section:
```markdown
### Configure Human-Readable ID Field ⚠️ CRITICAL

This configuration is **essential**. Without it, your records will display as confusing codes
like "rec_a7f3b2c1" instead of meaningful names.

1. In Form Settings panel, find **"Human-Readable ID Field"**
2. Click the dropdown and select **"Site Name"**

> **Why This Matters**: The Human-Readable ID Field determines how records display in the
> list. Setting it to "Site Name" means records show as "Test Location Alpha" (readable)
> instead of "rec_a7f3b2c1" (cryptic UUID).
```

### 2.4 Fix US Spelling Errors

- Line 141: "organize" → "organise"
- Line 207: "organize" → "organise"
- Line 399: "organized" → "organised"
- Search for any other US spellings: -ize, -ization, -or (favour/color), -er (centre)

### 2.5 Preserve All Critical Gold Standard Content

**Do NOT remove**:
- Two-URL architecture explanation (Dashboard vs App) in "Before You Start"
- Pagination and search guidance (Step 2)
- Dashboard return after save warning (Step 2)
- Offline-first architecture explanation (Step 4)
- Annotation/uncertainty feature demonstration (Site Type field)
- Complete Form Settings coverage (all 4 settings: Finish Button, Layout, Summary Fields, HRID)
- Settings tab sync controls tour (Step 4)

## Priority 3: Update Generation Prompt

**File**: `production/prompts/quickstart-generation-prompt.md`

Add new section after template structure, before execution:

```markdown
## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS FOR GENERATION

### Workflow and Architecture

1. **Notebook-First Workflow** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Direct users to: Dashboard → **Notebooks** → Create Notebook
   - **NEVER** start with Templates → Create Template
   - Template conversion is optional advanced step mentioned in "Next Steps" only
   - Rationale: Users test and refine notebooks, then convert proven designs to templates

2. **Activation Location** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Notebook activation occurs in **mobile app** (app.fieldmark.app)
   - **NOT** in Dashboard or Notebook Editor
   - There is **NO "Active (1)" toggle** in Editor's Info tab
   - Workflow: Mobile app → NOT ACTIVE tab → ACTIVATE button → ACTIVE tab

3. **List Behaviour Patterns** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - New notebooks appear at **END of list**, not beginning
   - **ALWAYS include**: pagination guidance and search bar instructions
   - Example: "Find your notebook at the end of the list. Use pagination controls or search."

4. **Save Behaviour** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Notebook Editor does **NOT auto-save**
   - Clicking SAVE **closes Editor and returns to Dashboard** (expected behaviour)
   - **ALWAYS warn users** this is normal, not an error
   - Include: "To resume editing: find notebook → Actions → Open in Editor"

5. **Two-URL Architecture** ⚠️ IMPORTANT
   - Dashboard URL (dashboard.fieldmark.app) - for designing notebooks
   - App URL (app.fieldmark.app) - for collecting data
   - Explain distinction in "Before You Start" section

### Field Configuration

6. **Three-Field Approach** ⚠️ REQUIRED
   - Add exactly **3 fields** (not 5, not 7):
     1. **Site Name** - FAIMS Text Field (single-line text, required)
     2. **Site Type** - Select one option (radio buttons, with annotation/uncertainty demo)
     3. **Site Photo** - Take Photo (media capture)
   - Defer other field types (datetime, multiline text) to "Next Steps"

7. **Form Settings Completeness** ⚠️ REQUIRED
   - Document **ALL four Form Settings**:
     1. Finish Button Behaviour
     2. Layout Style
     3. Summary Fields (select both Site Name and Site Type)
     4. **Human-Readable ID Field** (select Site Name) ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Add dramatic warning about HRID importance (prevents "rec_xxxxx" codes)

8. **Annotation and Uncertainty Features** ⚠️ REQUIRED
   - Demonstrate annotation and uncertainty on **Site Type field**
   - These are Fieldmark's unique features for data quality
   - Provide example: "Click blue dog ear icon → add note → check uncertainty"

### Scope and Structure

9. **Collaboration Exclusion** ⚠️ REQUIRED
   - **NO** detailed collaboration/permissions/roles in core tutorial
   - Brief mention in Next Steps only: "Invite team members - see [Collaboration Guide]"
   - Rationale: Premature for first-time users, deferred to dedicated docs

10. **Time Estimates** ⚠️ REQUIRED
    - Title: "Your First Notebook in 25-30 Minutes"
    - Step 1: 3-5 minutes
    - Step 2: 5-8 minutes
    - Step 3: 8-12 minutes (3 fields)
    - Step 4: 5-8 minutes
    - Total realistic: 21-33 minutes (claim 25-30)

11. **Optional Sections** ⚠️ REQUIRED
    - Mark "Troubleshooting" and "Power User Tips" as `{optional-reference}`
    - Add note: "Use this section if you encounter issues. Most users won't need it."
    - Structure: Core tutorial → Success Checklist → Next Steps → Troubleshooting → Tips

### Quality Requirements

12. **Screenshot Density**
    - Target: 25-30 screenshot placeholders (~1 every 20-25 lines)
    - Every major UI interaction should have visual reference

13. **Validation Checkboxes**
    - Use `- [ ]` checkbox format for all "You'll Know It Worked When" lists
    - Enables user progress tracking

14. **Progress Checks**
    - Add progress check callouts after completing groups of steps
    - Example: "> ✓ Progress Check: You should now see three fields..."

15. **UK/Australian English**
    - Use UK spelling throughout: organise, colour, behaviour, centre
    - Never use -ize, -ization, -or (in favour/color), -er (in centre)
```

---

## Priority 4: Rebuild and Validate

### Step 1: Rebuild Reference Documentation

After updating all source files:

```bash
cd /home/shawn/Code/prompts/EFN/Docs-staging/production
./scripts/build-reference.sh
```

Verify:
- No build errors
- reference.md updated with new content
- File size reasonable (~1.3-1.5 MB)

### Step 2: Re-run Quickstart Generation

Execute quickstart generation with updated prompt:
- Use updated production/reference.md
- Use updated production/prompts/quickstart-generation-prompt.md
- All 34 screenshots
- Output: `quickstart-regenerated-test-2025-10-05-v2.md`

### Step 3: Systematic Comparison

Compare regenerated v2 against revised gold standard:
- Technical Accuracy metrics (target: 95%+)
- Structural Completeness metrics (target: 90%+)
- Quality Indicators (target: 90%+)
- Critical errors (target: 0)
- Major errors (target: ≤2)

Generate: `quickstart-qa-report-2025-10-05-v2.md`

### Step 4: Success Criteria

**PASS Criteria**:
- ✅ Technical Accuracy ≥95% (from 50%)
- ✅ Structural Completeness ≥90% (from 75%)
- ✅ Overall compliance ≥92% (from 68%)
- ✅ Zero critical workflow-breaking errors (from 4)
- ✅ ≤2 major errors requiring manual correction

**If criteria met**: Automated quickstart generation is production-ready

## Key Insights from QA Test

### What Worked

1. **LLM follows prompt structure faithfully** - all required sections included
2. **Reference.md provides excellent field-level detail** - component names, types, configurations
3. **Structural innovations were genuine improvements** - troubleshooting section, checklist, checkboxes
4. **UK spelling compliance better than gold standard** - no "organize" errors in regenerated

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Workflow documentation insufficient** - multi-step processes not captured in source files
2. **System architecture not explicit enough** - two-URL system, activation location ambiguous
3. **Prompt lacks negative constraints** - doesn't prevent plausible-but-wrong inferences
4. **Pedagogical priorities buried** - notebook-first guidance in meta-documentation, not primary docs

### Critical Learning

**The LLM generates excellent structure but needs explicit workflow knowledge.**
Field-level documentation is sufficient. Process-level documentation (workflows, navigation sequences,
multi-step processes) needs significant enhancement in source files.

---

**Plan Status**: Ready for implementation
**Next Action**: Begin Session 1 - Critical Upstream Fixes
**Estimated Total Time**: 4-6 hours across 4 sessions
**Expected Result**: Production-ready automated quickstart generation (92%+ compliance)
