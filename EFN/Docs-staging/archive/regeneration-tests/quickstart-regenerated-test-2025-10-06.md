# Your First Notebook in 25-30 Minutes 🚀

*Welcome to Fieldmark! In the next 25-30 minutes, you'll create your first data collection notebook and enter your first record. No experience needed - just follow along!*

## What You'll Achieve

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ✅ Created a working notebook from scratch
- ✅ Added three essential fields for data collection
- ✅ Configured critical settings to prevent common mistakes
- ✅ Activated your notebook and entered your first record
- ✅ Gained confidence to build more sophisticated data collection tools

## Before You Start

**You'll need**: A Fieldmark account with at least Standard User permissions. If you don't have an account yet, ask your project administrator to invite you.

**Browser**: Works best with recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

**Two URLs you'll use**:
- **Dashboard** (`https://dashboard.fieldmark.app`) - for designing and managing notebooks
- **Data Collection App** (`https://app.fieldmark.app`) - for entering records in the field

### 📖 Quick Terms to Know

- **Dashboard**: Your control centre for creating and managing notebooks
- **Notebook**: A customisable data collection form (like a digital fieldwork form)
- **Notebook Editor**: The visual tool where you design your notebook structure
- **Records**: The actual data entries people create using your notebook
- **Fields**: Individual input elements (text boxes, dropdowns, photo buttons, etc.)

---

## Step 1: Access Your Dashboard (3-5 minutes)

Let's begin by logging in and familiarising ourselves with the Dashboard.

### Login to Fieldmark

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://dashboard.fieldmark.app`
2. Enter your email and password
3. Click **Sign In**

[SCREENSHOT: Login page showing email and password fields with green Sign In button]

### Welcome to Your Dashboard!

After logging in, you'll see the Dashboard interface:
- **Left sidebar**: Navigation options (Notebooks, Templates, Users, Teams)
- **Main content area**: Where you'll see lists of notebooks and templates
- **User menu**: Your profile icon in the **bottom-left corner**

[SCREENSHOT: Dashboard showing left sidebar navigation, main content area with notebook list, and user menu in bottom-left]

> ✨ **Pro Tip**: Bookmark this Dashboard page - you'll return here often to manage your notebooks.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...

- [ ] You see your name or email in the bottom-left user menu
- [ ] The Dashboard shows navigation options: Notebooks, Templates, Users, Teams
- [ ] You see a list of notebooks (or "No notebooks yet" if this is a new account)
- [ ] No error messages or login prompts appear

Great! You're in. Now let's create something amazing.

---

## Step 2: Create Your First Notebook (5-8 minutes)

**IMPORTANT**: We're creating a notebook directly, not from a template. Templates are an advanced feature - for now, we'll start simple.

### Navigate to Notebook Creation

1. Click **Notebooks** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **+ Create Notebook** button (usually in the top-right)

[SCREENSHOT: Notebooks view showing the Create Notebook button]

### Name Your Notebook

In the creation dialogue:
1. **Notebook Name**: Enter "My First Survey" (or choose your own name)
2. **Select team**: Choose your team from the dropdown
   - If you have only one team, it may be pre-selected
   - If you have multiple teams, select the appropriate one
3. Leave optional fields empty for now
4. Click **Create Notebook**

### Find Your New Notebook

**CRITICAL**: After creation, your notebook will appear at the **END of the notebook list**, not at the beginning.

1. If you have many notebooks, use these navigation tools:
   - **Search bar**: Type "My First Survey" in the search box at the top of the list
   - **Pagination controls**: Look at the bottom for "1-10 of X notebooks" with arrow buttons to navigate pages
2. Scroll through the list to find your notebook (it will be at the end)
3. Click on your notebook name to select it

[SCREENSHOT: Notebook list showing pagination controls at bottom and search bar at top]

### Open the Notebook Editor

1. Click the **Actions** tab
2. Click **Open in Editor**

[SCREENSHOT: Notebook details showing Actions tab with Open in Editor button]

### Hello, Notebook Editor!

Fantastic! You're now in the Notebook Editor - this is where you'll design your data collection form.

The Editor has three main areas:
- **Top bar**: SAVE and CANCEL buttons (top-right), UNDO and REDO buttons (below top bar)
- **Tab bar**: DESIGN and INFO tabs
- **Form editing area**: Where you'll build your forms, sections, and fields

[SCREENSHOT: Notebook Editor interface showing top bar with SAVE/CANCEL, UNDO/REDO buttons, DESIGN/INFO tabs, and form editing area]

> 📱 **Mobile Users**: The Notebook Editor works best on tablets or computers. Once you've designed your notebook, it will work beautifully on mobile for data collection!

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...

- [ ] You see the Notebook Editor interface with DESIGN tab selected
- [ ] SAVE and CANCEL buttons are visible in the top-right
- [ ] UNDO and REDO buttons appear below the top bar
- [ ] You see "Form Name" field with a green "ADD NEW FORM" button
- [ ] No error messages appear

Perfect! Now let's build the structure.

---

## Step 3: Add Your Fields (8-12 minutes)

We'll create a simple form with three essential fields that demonstrate the main types of data you can collect.

### Understanding the Hierarchy

Before we start, understand how Fieldmark organises data:

**Notebook** → **Form** → **Section** → **Fields**

You MUST create them in this order:
1. First: Create a Form
2. Then: Create a Section within that form
3. Finally: Add Fields to that section

> ⚠️ **Don't Skip Steps**: You cannot add fields without first creating a section!

### Create Your Form

1. In the "Form Name" field, type **"Site Survey"** (or choose your own name)
2. Click the green **"ADD NEW FORM"** button

You'll see confirmation that your form was created, with a badge showing "FORM: SITE SURVEY".

[SCREENSHOT: Form created successfully with "FORM: SITE SURVEY" badge and green success message]

### Create Your Section

Sections help organise related fields within a form.

1. Find the "Section Name" field (it appears below the form you just created)
2. Type **"Basic Information"**
3. Click the **"+" button** next to the Section Name field

You'll see your section appear with a numbered badge (1) and section controls.

[SCREENSHOT: Section created successfully showing numbered badge "1", section name "Basic Information", and "ADD A FIELD" button]

> ✓ **Progress Check**: You should now see your form ("Site Survey") with one section ("Basic Information") and a green "ADD A FIELD" button. Great work!

### Field 1: Site Name (Text Field)

Let's add our first field for collecting site names.

1. Click the green **"ADD A FIELD"** button
2. In the "Add a field" dialogue that opens:
   - **Field name**: Type **"Site Name"**
   - **Field type**: Make sure the **TEXT** tab is selected
   - Click on **"FAIMS Text Field"** (single-line text input)
   - Click **"ADD FIELD"** at the bottom

3. The field will appear in your Visible Fields list. Click the **grey bar** to expand it
4. Configure the field:
   - **Label**: Already shows "Site Name" ✓
   - **Helper Text**: Type "Enter the official site designation or name"
   - **Required**: Toggle this ON (checkbox should show a green checkmark)

[SCREENSHOT: Expanded Site Name field showing Label, Helper Text "Enter the official site designation or name", and Required checkbox checked]

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...

- [ ] The "Site Name" field appears in the Visible Fields area
- [ ] Helper text displays: "Enter the official site designation or name"
- [ ] Required checkbox is checked with a green checkmark
- [ ] The field shows "FAIMSTextField" badge

Excellent! One down, two to go.

### Field 2: Site Type (Radio Buttons)

Now let's add a choice field where users select from predefined options.

1. Collapse the Site Name field (click the grey bar)
2. Click **"ADD A FIELD"** again
3. In the dialogue:
   - **Field name**: Type **"Site Type"**
   - **Navigate to Choice fields**: Click the right chevron (>) next to the tabs to see more categories
   - Click the **CHOICE** tab
   - Click on **"Select one option"** (this creates radio buttons)
   - Click **"ADD FIELD"**

4. Click the grey bar to expand the field
5. Add your options - you'll see one default option. Let's create a list of site types:
   - Click the **pencil icon** next to the default option
   - Change it to **"Habitation"** and click SAVE
   - Use the "Add Option" field to add more options:
     - **"Mortuary"**
     - **"Ceremonial"**
     - **"Agricultural"**
     - **"Industrial"**
     - **"Other"**

6. Configure the field:
   - **Label**: Already shows "Site Type" ✓
   - **Helper Text**: Type "Select the primary function of this site"
   - **Required**: Toggle ON

[SCREENSHOT: Expanded Site Type field showing all 6 options (Habitation, Mortuary, Ceremonial, Agricultural, Industrial, Other) with Required checkbox checked]

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...

- [ ] The "Site Type" field shows all 6 options in the list
- [ ] A green "Required" badge appears in the field header
- [ ] Helper text displays: "Select the primary function of this site"
- [ ] The field shows "RadioGroup" badge

> ✓ **Progress Check**: You should now see two fields in your Visible Fields list. You're doing great!

### Field 3: Site Photo (Camera)

Let's add the ability to capture photos - essential for field documentation!

1. Collapse the Site Type field
2. Click **"ADD A FIELD"**
3. In the dialogue:
   - **Field name**: Type **"Site Photo"**
   - Click the **MEDIA** tab
   - Click on **"Take Photo"** (enables camera capture)
   - Click **"ADD FIELD"**

4. Click the grey bar to expand the field
5. Configure:
   - **Label**: Already shows "Site Photo" ✓
   - **Helper Text**: Type "Photograph the site for documentation"
   - Leave **Required** unchecked (photos can be optional)

[SCREENSHOT: Expanded Site Photo field showing Label, Helper Text "Photograph the site for documentation", and TakePhoto configuration]

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...

- [ ] The "Site Photo" field appears with "TakePhoto" badge
- [ ] Helper text displays: "Photograph the site for documentation"
- [ ] All three fields are visible: Site Name, Site Type, Site Photo

[SCREENSHOT: All three fields shown in collapsed list view - Site Name (FAIMSTextField, Required), Site Type (RadioGroup, Required), Site Photo (TakePhoto)]

> 🎯 **Milestone Achieved**: You've created three fields covering the main data types! Now let's configure critical form settings.

### Configure Form Settings (CRITICAL!)

This step is **essential** - it prevents your records from displaying as confusing codes.

1. Scroll to the top of your form to find the **Form Settings** panel
2. Click on the grey "Form Settings" bar to expand it if it's collapsed
3. Configure these settings:
   - **Finish Button Behaviour**: Leave as "Always Show"
   - **Layout Style**: Leave as "Tabs"
   - **Summary Fields**: Click the dropdown and select both **"Site Name"** and **"Site Type"**
     (These will appear in the record list table)
   - **Human-Readable ID Field**: Select **"Site Name"**

[SCREENSHOT: Form Settings panel showing all four configuration options with dropdowns]

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL: Human-Readable ID Field**
>
> **DO NOT skip this setting!** This is a very common and serious mistake new users make.
>
> Without setting the Human-Readable ID Field, your records will display as:
> - ❌ `rec_a7f3b2c1` (meaningless code - which site is this??)
> - ❌ `rec_9d2e4b8f` (impossible to identify!)
> - ❌ `rec_f1c5a39e` (you'll never find what you're looking for)
>
> With Human-Readable ID Field set to "Site Name", your records display as:
> - ✅ `Ancient Temple Site` (instantly recognisable!)
> - ✅ `Northern Settlement` (clear and meaningful!)
> - ✅ `Burial Ground Alpha` (easy to find and manage!)
>
> **Set it now before saving!** Changing it later won't fix existing records.

[SCREENSHOT: Form Settings fully configured showing "Site Name" selected as Human-Readable ID Field]

### Save Your Work

**IMPORTANT**: The Notebook Editor does NOT auto-save.

1. Click the green **SAVE** button in the top-right corner
2. **You'll be returned to the Dashboard** - this is expected behaviour, not an error!
3. To resume editing later, simply select your notebook and click "Open in Editor" again

> ⚠️ **Remember**: Clicking SAVE closes the Editor and returns you to the Dashboard. This is normal! You can immediately click "Open in Editor" to continue working.

Congratulations! 🎉 Your notebook structure is saved!

---

## Step 4: Activate and Test Your Notebook (5-8 minutes)

Time to see your creation in action! Let's activate your notebook and enter your first record.

### Navigate to the Data Collection App

**CRITICAL**: Notebook activation happens in the **mobile/data collection app**, NOT in the Dashboard or Editor.

1. Open a **new browser tab**
2. Navigate to `https://app.fieldmark.app`
3. **Log in** with the same credentials you used for the Dashboard

[SCREENSHOT: Data collection app login page]

### Activate Your Notebook

When the app opens, you'll see the "My Notebooks" screen with two tabs:

1. Click the **NOT ACTIVE** tab
   - This shows notebooks available to activate on your device
2. Find your notebook ("My First Survey") in the list
   - If you have many notebooks, scroll through the list
3. Click the green **ACTIVATE** button next to your notebook

[SCREENSHOT: NOT ACTIVE tab showing list of notebooks with green ACTIVATE buttons]

4. A modal dialogue appears explaining activation
5. Read the information and click the green **ACTIVATE** button in the modal to confirm

[SCREENSHOT: Activation modal dialogue with explanation and ACTIVATE/CANCEL buttons]

6. You'll automatically switch to the **ACTIVE** tab - your notebook now appears there!

[SCREENSHOT: ACTIVE tab showing activated notebook in the list]

> 💡 **What does activation mean?** Activating downloads your notebook structure to your device for offline use. Fieldmark works offline-first, so you can collect data anywhere without internet connectivity. Data syncs automatically when you're back online.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...

- [ ] The view switches to the ACTIVE tab
- [ ] Your notebook appears in the ACTIVE list
- [ ] You can click on the notebook name to open it

### Open Your Notebook and Create Your First Record

1. Click on your notebook name in the ACTIVE tab
2. You'll see the record list interface:
   - **ADD NEW SITE SURVEY** button (orange) - for creating new records
   - **MY SITE SURVEYS (0)** tab - your record list (currently empty)
   - Table with column headers (Site Name, Site Type, Created, etc.)

[SCREENSHOT: Empty notebook showing ADD NEW SITE SURVEY button and empty table with "No rows" message]

3. Click the orange **"ADD NEW SITE SURVEY"** button

### Fill in Your First Record

You'll see your data entry form with a progress bar at the top showing completion percentage.

1. **Site Name**: Type "Test Location Alpha" (or any site name)
   - Notice the red asterisk (*) indicating this is required
   - Helper text reminds you: "Enter the official site designation or name"

2. **Site Type**: Select "Habitation" (or any option from your list)
   - The radio buttons show all your options
   - Helper text: "Select the primary function of this site"

3. **Site Photo** (optional):
   - Click the green **"TAKE FIRST PHOTO"** button
   - Allow camera permissions if prompted
   - Take any photo (even of your desk - this is practice!)

[SCREENSHOT: Data entry form showing all three fields filled in with 100% completion bar]

### Save Your Record

At the bottom of the form, you'll see action buttons:

- **FINISH AND CLOSE SITE-SURVEY** (green) - saves and returns to the record list
- **FINISH AND NEW SITE-SURVEY** (orange) - saves and opens a new blank form
- **CANCEL** (orange) - discards without saving

Click **"FINISH AND CLOSE SITE-SURVEY"** to save!

### View Your Record

Congratulations! 🎊 You're automatically returned to the record list.

You'll see your record in the table:
- **Sync column**: Orange icon (not yet synced to server) - will turn green when synced
- **Site Name**: "Test Location Alpha" (your Human-Readable ID!)
- **Site Type**: "Habitation"
- **Created**: Timestamp
- **Created By**: Your username
- Pagination shows "1-1 of 1"

[SCREENSHOT: Record list showing one record with Site Name "Test Location Alpha" and Site Type "Habitation"]

> 💡 **About Sync**: The orange sync icon means your record is saved locally but hasn't uploaded to the server yet. It will automatically sync when you're online. Once synced, the icon turns into a green cloud with a checkmark.

### ✓ You'll Know It Worked When...

- [ ] You see your record in the table with the Site Name you entered (NOT "rec_xxxxx"!)
- [ ] The MY SITE SURVEYS tab shows "(1)" indicating one record
- [ ] Pagination shows "1-1 of 1"
- [ ] All your entered data appears in the table columns

## Troubleshooting {optional-reference}

> 💡 **Note**: This section is optional reference material. Most users won't encounter these issues. Refer to this section if you get stuck.

### Can't Find the Notebook Editor

**Solution**: Navigate to Notebooks (left sidebar) → click your notebook name → Actions tab → Open in Editor. If you don't see "Open in Editor", check with your administrator about your permissions.

### Notebook Not in List After Creation

**Solution**: New notebooks appear at the **END of the list**, not the beginning. Use the search bar at the top of the list to search for your notebook name, or use pagination controls at the bottom to navigate to the last page.

### Fields Not Showing in the Form

**Solution**: Make sure you completed all steps in the hierarchy:
1. Created a Form (clicked ADD NEW FORM)
2. Created a Section (entered section name and clicked +)
3. Added Fields (clicked ADD A FIELD)

Check that fields are in "Visible Fields" (not "Hidden Fields").

### Editor Closed After Clicking Save

**This is expected behaviour**: The Notebook Editor does NOT auto-save. Clicking SAVE closes the Editor and returns you to the Dashboard. Your work is saved! To resume editing, select your notebook → Actions → Open in Editor.

### Records Show "rec_xxxxx" Instead of Readable Names

**Solution**: This is a very common mistake! Open your notebook in the Editor, find the Form Settings panel, and set the "Human-Readable ID Field" to a text field like "Site Name". Save the changes. New records will display properly (existing records will keep the old format - you may need to edit and re-save them).

### Notebook Not Appearing in Mobile App

**Solution**: Make sure you're logged into the mobile app (app.fieldmark.app) with the same credentials you used in the Dashboard. If you still don't see it, check with your administrator about team permissions.

### Photos Won't Upload

**Solution**: On mobile devices, check that you've granted camera permissions in your device settings. On desktop, the Take Photo field works best on devices with cameras (mobile phones, tablets, or laptops with webcams).

## What's Next?

Ready to take your notebook further? Here are immediate next steps:

- **Invite team members** - Share your notebook and assign roles (Data Collector, Reviewer, Admin) through the Control Centre
- **Add more fields** - Explore date/time fields, geolocation, multi-line text, and more
- **Create conditional logic** - Make forms that adapt based on user input
- **Export your data** - Download records as CSV or JSON for analysis
- **Turn your notebook into a template** (advanced) - Once you've field-tested your design, you can convert it to a template for reuse across similar projects
- **Explore offline capabilities** - Test data collection without internet to see Fieldmark's offline-first design in action

> 💡 **Templates Are Advanced**: We started with direct notebook creation because it's best to field-test your design before creating reusable templates. Once you're comfortable with notebooks, explore template creation for projects that need repeatable patterns.
