Can you please complete the following 'end of field' checklist, updating related documents as needed?

## Session End - Field Complete
Date/Time: 2025-08-13 22:30
Completed: TemplatedString Field - third draft done
**Time spent**: Estimated 1.5-2 hrs → Actual: 1.5 hrs
**Efficiency notes**: Proceeded at expected rate; 5 clarifying Q&A rounds were efficient

### Matrix Updates Required
- [✅] Mark TemplatedString Field as COMPLETE in Third Draft column
- [✅] Update completion percentage (currently 3/25 = 12% → 4/25 = 16%)
- [✅] Add technical discoveries to log
- [✅] Update session handover box with next field
- [✅] Note any Claude Code questions for next field

### Quality Assurance Checklist
Before marking a field complete:
- [✅] All 14 template sections present (13 in our template - all included)
- [✅] Validation table populated (5 validation types with behaviors)
- [✅] Platform behaviours documented (Desktop, iOS, Android)
- [✅] 2-3 JSON examples included (4 comprehensive examples)
- [✅] Troubleshooting guide written (8-issue table + debug checklist)
- [✅] Cross-references added (7 references)
- [✅] Technical accuracy verified (via 5 Q&A rounds)
- [✅] Heritage example included (multiple archaeological examples)

### Documentation Metrics
- JSON examples provided: 4 (target: 3-4) ✅
- Troubleshooting issues covered: 8 (target: 5-8) ✅
- Cross-references added: 7 (target: 5+) ✅
- Word count: ~3000 (typical: 2000-3000) ✅

### Technical Discoveries
**Critical Behaviors**:
- ALL templates re-evaluate on ANY field change (not selective)
- Circular references prevented by filtering ALL template fields from context
**Implementation Details**:
- Mustache.js with HTML escaping disabled
- System variables have built-in fallbacks ("Unknown User"/"Unknown Time")
**Limitations/Constraints**:
- Field is hardcoded read-only - no configuration override possible
- No partials, functions, or lambdas in Mustache templates
**Performance Notes**:
- Multiple complex templates may impact form responsiveness
- Consider limiting to 1-3 templates per form

### Next Field Preparation
- Field: QRCodeFormField (Scan QR Code)
- Package: A (Critical Text Fields)
- **Questions to investigate**:
  - What barcode formats are supported beyond QR codes?
  - How does the field handle scan failures or unreadable codes?
  - Can scanned values trigger auto-population of other fields?
- **Potential blind spots**:
  - Camera permission handling across platforms
  - Desktop browser behavior (no camera)
  - Offline scanning capabilities

### Session Status
- [✅] Documentation saved to artifact
- [✅] No truncation or context issues
- [✅] All Q&A incorporated
- [✅] Ready for production use

### Files to Update
- [✅] Field Documentation Progress Matrix (update existing document)
- [✅] Bug report and feature requests (produce a list to *append* to the existing document; do not update existing document)
- [N/A] Update master tracking document if needed (update existing document)
