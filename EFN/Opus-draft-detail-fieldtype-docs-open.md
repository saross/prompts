Hi Opus,

We are continuing a large documentation task, which we are proceeding through carefully, one step at a time, to ensure quality, comprehensiveness, and consistency.

Please load:
1. Field Documentation Progress Matrix (for status & checklist)
2. Phase 1 Focus document (for standards)
3. Completed field examples (TextField, MultilineText, Email, TemplatedString)

## Documentation Session Start
**Date/Time**: 2025-08-14 08:00
**Phase**: 1 - Field Documentation to Third Draft
**Previous Session**: Completed TemplatedString Field third draft (4/25 fields complete - 16%)
**This Session Goal**: Complete QRCodeFormField third draft

### Current Status
- Completed fields: TextField, MultilineText, Email, TemplatedString
- Working on: QRCodeFormField (mobile-only barcode scanner)
- Package: Continuing Package A (Critical Text Fields)

### Questions / Blind Spots to Investigate
- Supported barcode formats beyond QR
- Scan failure handling
- Pattern validation options
- Camera permission handling across platforms
- Offline scanning capabilities
- Barcode format limitations
- Integration with device-specific scanner apps
- Fallback options for desktop browsers without cameras

### Plan for This Session
1. For the QRCodeFormField, please review current 'second-draft' documentation in 'Text Fields - Detailed Documentation.md'
2. Gap analysis: Review second-draft against Template Compliance Checklist and explicitly list missing sections/information needed to produce 'third-draft' documentation.
3. Clarify loop: ask me (or I can also pass queries to Claude Code) clarifying questions one question at a time until you estimate with >95% confidence that the information about the field is sufficient to meet third-draft documentation specifications.  
4. Blueprint: when you reach 95% confidence, produce a brief, crisp outline of the detailed field-type third-draft documentation (max 1/10th length of actual documentation), in chat (not as an artifact). 
5. Build and self-test:      
- Once you get approval to generate the complete text, write the full third-draft documentation for QRCodeFormField.     
- Check for compliance against all necessary sections from the template in 'Template Compliance Checklist' for the QRCodeFormField.
- Do a consistency check matching style of completed TextField/MultilineText/Email/TemplatedString documentation
- Do a final internal consistency check and style alignment check ('academic eloquence' style)     
- Fix any errors or deviations you find from the above checks, asking questions if necessary.
- Deliver the final third-draft documentation as a markdown artifact.
- Document any technical discoveries for the Technical Discoveries Log

### Expected Deliverables
- [ ] Full third-draft documentation (13-14 sections)
- [ ] 3-4 JSON examples with expected behaviors
- [ ] Validation rules table
- [ ] Troubleshooting table with debug checklist
- [ ] Technical discoveries logged

Note: If approaching context limits, complete current section before stopping and create handover notes.

Confirm you are ready to proceed with QRCodeFormField third draft.
