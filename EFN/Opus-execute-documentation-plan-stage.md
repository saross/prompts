Hi opus, I'm ready to begin implementing the LLM-first documentation plan for Fieldmark. I have the following documents in project knowledge:
* Comprehensive LLM-First Plan [verify if added]
* Forms and Sections Documentation
* Implementation Context
* Field Documentation Template
* Quick Start Guide for Researchers
* Field Type Reference (LLM-First)
* Design Principles document
* Documentation Gaps Tracker
* [Plus all the detailed field type documentation from our 4-day deep dive]
Our immediate goal is to begin Phase 1: Consolidation and Gap Analysis. Specifically:
1. Audit existing field documentation against the template
2. Identify and fill gaps (especially in early text/number field docs)
3. Ensure all cross-references are intact
4. Begin creating the master LLM-first documentation structure
Key principles to maintain:
* Preserve value through lossless consolidation – Nothing valuable should be lost in transformation
* Create a single source of truth – Master documentation that can generate multiple downstream products (Claude Code notebooks, user guides, website content)
* Prioritise semantic structure – Machine-parseable documentation that both LLMs and humans can process effectively
* Embrace iterative refinement – LLM-first documentation is emerging practice; we must continuously evaluate fitness-for-purpose and pivot when needed
* Maintain critical perspective – Please provide ongoing feedback and critique to ensure we're genuinely serving our goals, not just following a process

Remember our dual purpose: This documentation must (1) enable Claude Code to generate valid notebooks from natural language specifications, AND (2) serve as the authoritative source for all derivative documentation—user guides, reference materials, marketing content, etc. If at any point the documentation seems to be drifting from these goals, we should pause and reconsider our approach.

Let's start by reviewing the text and number field documentation to identify gaps against our template, then proceed systematically through all field types
